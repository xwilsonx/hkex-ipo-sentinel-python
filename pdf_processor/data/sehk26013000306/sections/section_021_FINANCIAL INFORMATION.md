development. In 2023 and 2024, and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2025, our total R&D expenses amounted to RMB185.8 million, RMB191.2 million,
RMB145.7 million and RMB173.9 million, respectively. We have been focused on
building a comprehensive R&D system, with technology and product innovation
serving as the primary drivers of our business development.

We have assembled a sizable, experienced, and seasoned professional R&D team.
The core members possess profound professional backgrounds and years of R&D
practical experience in the power electronics, electromagnetic technology, and related
application fields. This high-caliber team serves as driving force for our continuous
technological breakthroughs and product innovation.

We have translated our R&D efforts into a range of core technologies and
commercialized products. See “Business — Research and Development — Our R&D
Achievements.” We intend to continue strengthening our R&D capabilities to support
our future business development.

Our Global Footprint

We have established a global footprint and localized service capabilities in
overseas markets, enabling us to provide end-to-end localized services throughout the
entire lifecycle, from pre-sales consultation and product manufacturing to after-sales
support. In 2023 and 2024, and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025,
the revenue generated from countries and regions outside Chinese Mainland accounted
for 27.1%, 29.5%, 29.5% and 33.8% of our total revenue, respectively. Our overseas
presence forms an international operating platform that supports our global business.
We intend to continue optimizing and expanding our global network, which is expected
to help diversify our market exposure and enhance our resilience to regional market
fluctuations.

Our Cost Control and Operational Efficiency Improvement

Our ability to effectively control costs and expenses is critical to our results of
operations. In 2023 and 2024, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2025, our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue were 78.3%, 79.9%, 78.5% and
82.2%, respectively.

During the Track Record Period, materials costs have been the largest component
of our cost of sales. In 2023 and 2024, and the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2025, our cost of materials amounted to RMB2,504.8 million, RMB3,173.9
million, RMB2,170.2 million and RMB2,574.2 million, respectively, accounting for
88.4%, 86.3%, 85.8% and 83.1% of our total cost of sales, respectively. As a result,
changes in the prices of our major materials may have a direct impact on our cost of
sales and, in turn, our financial performance. The prices of our major materials may
fluctuate with market conditions. To mitigate the impact of such price fluctuations, we
procure major materials through standardized and stringent supplier selection and
management procedures. See “Business — Procurement and Supply Chain
Management, and Suppliers” for more details.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Our operating expenses primarily consist of cost of sales, research and
development expenses, selling expenses and general and administrative expenses. Our
ability to manage operating expenses efficiently also affects our profitability. As our
business grows, we believe we may benefit from economies of scale, which could
improve our operational efficiency and profitability over time.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES

We set out below those material accounting policies that we believe are of critical
importance to our financial reporting and that involve significant judgments, estimates and
assumptions in the preparation of our Historical Financial Information. These accounting
policies and related estimates and judgments are important for understanding our financial
condition and results of operations and have been consistently applied during the Track
Record Period. Our material accounting policies and the key areas that involve significant
management judgment, estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in Notes
3.2 and 4 to the Accountants’ Report included in Appendix I to this Document.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue mainly arises from sales of new energy products, lighting products, power
distribution products, industrial control products and data center products and others.

To determine whether to recognize revenue, we follow a five-step process:

1. Identifying the contract with a customer;

2. Identifying the performance obligations;

3. Determining the transaction price;

4. Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations; and

5. Recognizing revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied.

In all cases, the total transaction price for a contract is allocated amongst the various
performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. The transaction
price for a contract excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

Revenue is recognized either at a point in time, when we satisfy performance
obligations by transferring the promised goods to our customers.

Revenue from sale of goods

Revenue from sale of goods between us and our customers generally only includes a
performance obligation for the transfer of goods, which is recognized when the performance
obligation has been satisfied at a point in time.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Revenue for domestic sale of goods is recognized when the products have been
delivered to the customer as stipulated in the contract, and the customer has accepted the
goods; it is probable that related economic benefits will flow to us; the significant risks and
rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred; and ownership of the goods has
been transferred.

Revenue for overseas sale of goods is recognized when customs declaration procedures
for the products have been completed as stipulated in the contract and the customs
declaration forms have been obtained; it is probable that related economic benefits will flow
to us; the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred; and
ownership of the goods has been transferred.

Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

The following assets are subject to impairment testing:

. Intangible assets;

. Property, plant and equipment;

. Goodwill;

. Right-of-use assets; and

. The Company’s investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture.

Assets with indefinite useful life or those not yet available for use are tested for
impairment at least annually, irrespective of whether there is any indication that they are
impaired. All other assets are tested for impairment whenever there are indications that the
asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable.

An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately for the amount by which
the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the
higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs of disposal, and value in use. In
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of time value of money
and the risk specific to the asset.

For the purpose of assessing impairment, where an asset does not generate cash inflows
largely independent of those from other assets, the recoverable amount is determined for
the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows independently (i.e., a cash generating
unit (“CGU”)). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are
tested at CGU level. Corporate assets are allocated to individual CGUs, when a reasonable
and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, or otherwise they are allocated to the
smallest group of CGUs for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be
identified.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Impairment losses recognised for CGU, to which goodwill has been allocated, are
credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is
charged pro rata to the other assets in the CGU, except that the carrying value of an asset
will not be reduced below its individual fair value less cost of disposal, or value in use, if
determinable.

An impairment loss on goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. In respect of
other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the
estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount and only to the extent that the
asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment (other than construction in progress as described
below) are initially recognised at acquisition cost and/or manufacturing cost (including any
cost directly attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for
them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by our management, including costs
of testing whether the related assets are functioning properly). They are subsequently stated
at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Properties in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative
purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Costs include professional
fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with our
accounting policy. Such properties are classified to the appropriate categories of property,
plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation of these
assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for
their intended use.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets other than construction
in progress less their residual values using the straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives as follow:

Properties and buildings 5–40 years
Machinery 3–10 years
Transportation equipment 3–5 years
Electronic equipment and other equipment 3–10 years
Leasehold improvements 3–5 years

The land purchased by us overseas with permanent property rights is recognized as
freehold land and is not depreciated.

Estimates of residual value and useful life are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at
the end of each year/period for the Track Record Period.

Gain or loss arising on retirement or disposal is determined as the difference between
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a
separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the item will flow to us and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other costs, such as repairs
and maintenance, are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are
incurred.

Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty and Significant Judgments

In applying our accounting policies, our management is required to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions concerning the future. These involve significant risk of resulting
in material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and are reviewed on
an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Key areas where significant judgment and estimation uncertainty exist include:

Impairment of financial assets and contract assets

The loss allowances for financial assets and contract assets are based on
assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. We use judgment in
making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation,
based on our past history, existing market conditions, as well as forward-looking
estimates at the end of each year/period for the Track Record Period. Details of the
key assumptions and inputs used are disclosed in the tables in Note 45 to the
Accountants’ Report included in Appendix I to this Document.

Inventory provision

We measure the inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and make
inventory provision for the obsolete inventory, slow-moving inventory and the
inventory of which the cost is higher than their net realizable value. The net
realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the
estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Even
though the management of us has made the best estimate about the inventory
impairment loss predicted to occur and provided allowance for impairment, the
impairment assessment may still be significantly changed due to the change of market
situation.

Fair value measurement of financial assets at level 3 fair value hierarchy

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is
determined using valuation techniques. We use its judgment to select a variety of
methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at
the end of each reporting period. For details of the valuation techniques, inputs and
key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of financial assets at level 3
fair value hierarchy are disclosed in the tables in Note 44 to the Accountants’ Report
included in Appendix I to this Document.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Income taxes and deferred income taxations

There are many transactions and events for which the ultimate tax determination
is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Significant judgements are
required from us in determining the provisions for income taxes. Where the final tax
outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded,
such differences will impact the income tax and deferred income tax provisions in the
period in which such determination is made.

We recognize deferred income tax assets based on estimates that it is probable to
generate sufficient taxable profits in the foreseeable future against which the deductible
losses will be utilised. The recognition of deferred income tax assets mainly involves
management’s judgements and estimations about the timing and the amount of taxable
profits of the companies who has tax losses.

Recognition of share-based compensation expenses

Estimating the fair value of share-based payment transactions requires the
determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which depends on the terms
and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires the determination of the most
appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the significant input of expected
life of the share incentive granted, expected volatility, and risk-free rate and making
assumptions about them.

For the measurement of the fair value of share-based payment transactions with
employees at the grant date, we use a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment
transactions are disclosed in Note 36 to the Accountants’ Report included in Appendix
I to this Document.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets with finite useful lives and
right-of-use assets

Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets with finite useful lives and
right-of-use assets are stated at costs less accumulated depreciation or amortisation
and impairment, if any. In determining whether an asset is impaired, the Group has to
exercise judgement and make estimation, particularly in assessing: (1) whether an event
has occurred or any indicators that may affect the asset value; (2) whether the carrying
amount of an asset can be supported by the recoverable amount, in the case of value in
use, the net present value of future cash flows which are estimated based upon the
continued use of the asset; and (3) the appropriate key assumptions to be applied in
estimating the recoverable amounts including cash flow projections and an appropriate
discount rate. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an
individual asset (including right-of-use assets), the Group estimates the recoverable
amount of the CGU to which the assets belongs. Changing the assumptions and
estimates, including the discount rates or the growth rate in the cash flow projections,
could materially affect the net present value used in the impairment test.

Our other income increased by 43.0% from RMB45.7 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 to RMB65.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2025, primarily due to (i) an increase in deferred government grants related to capital
expenditures for our business expansion, (ii) an increase in government grants received for
our operations in Chinese Mainland, (iii) an increase in value added tax and other tax
credits concessions; and (iv) an increase in miscellaneous non-operating income, such as
compensation income and miscellaneous receipts.

Impairment Losses Reversed/(Recognised) on Financial Assets and Contract Assets, Net

Our net impairment losses on financial assets and contract assets decreased by 112.4%
from RMB6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to RMB0.7 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to an improvement in the overall
credit quality of our trade receivables and a reduction in balances subject to higher expected
credit loss rates, resulting in lower impairment provisions recognized during the period.

Other (Losses)/Gains, Net

We incurred other gains, net of RMB10.6 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and other losses, net of RMB2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2025, primarily due to increased foreign exchange losses resulting from exchange rate

had liabilities under supplier financing arrangement of RMB72.9 million, RMB599.6
million, RMB582.2 million, and RMB628.5 million, respectively. Our liabilities under
supplier financing arrangements mainly represented our unconditional payment obligations
under electronic debt certificates issued to suppliers through a third-party supply chain

measured at the present value of the redemption amount and subsequently measured at
amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest charged to finance costs.
See Note 33 to the Accountants’ Report in Appendix I to this Document.

SUFFICIENCY OF WORKING CAPITAL

During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, our primary
source of liquidity has been and is expected to continue to be cash flows generated from
operating activities and bank loans obtained through notes receivable. Our cash and cash
equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits placed with financial institutions.

In the future, we believe our liquidity requirements can be met through a combination
of the following: cash generated from operating activities, our available unused bank credit
facilities, other funds raised from the capital markets from time to time, and the

[REDACTED] from this [REDACTED]. We do not anticipate any changes in the sources of
financing for our future working capital. Considering the financial resources available to
the Company, the Directors are of the opinion that the Company has sufficient working
capital to meet its present and estimated requirements for at least the next 12 months from
the date of this Document.

DIVIDEND POLICY

Pursuant to the Company’s Articles of Association, the Company has adopted a

cash dividends, including that the Company may, subject to its financial performance,
capital requirements and other relevant factors, consider distributing a portion of its
distributable profits in cash. However, the Company does not have a fixed dividend payout
ratio. Any declaration or payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board and
the approval of Shareholders, after taking into account the Company’s results of
operations, financial condition, operating and capital requirements and other factors it
considers relevant. There can be no assurance as to the timing, amount or form of any
future dividends.

Final dividends of RMB75.2 million (RMB2.50 per 10 shares), RMB115.7 million
(RMB3.00 per 10 shares) and RMB116.4 million (RMB3.00 per 10 shares) in respect of the
years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, were approved by the annual
