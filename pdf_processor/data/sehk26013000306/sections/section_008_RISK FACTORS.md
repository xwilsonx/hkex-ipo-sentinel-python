will not be updated after the date hereof and is subject to the cautionary statements in the
section headed “Forward-looking Statements” in this Document. You should seek
professional advice from relevant advisors regarding your prospective [REDACTED] in
the context of your particular circumstances.


We believe there are certain risks and uncertainties involved in our operations, some of
which are beyond our control. We have categorized these risks and uncertainties into: (i)
risks relating to our business and industry; (ii) risks relating to our financial position and
need for additional capital; (iii) risks relating to conducting business in jurisdictions where
we operate; and (iv) risks relating to the [REDACTED].

Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently not known to us or not expressed
or implied below or that we currently deem immaterial could also harm our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. You should consider our business
and prospects in light of the challenges we face, including the ones discussed in this section.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY

Our business is subject to cyclicality and macroeconomic fluctuations in the industries we
serve.

Our business is affected by the overall macroeconomic environment and the investment
and consumption cycles in the industries and end-markets we serve, including industrial,
consumer electronics and other application sectors. Demand for our products may be
influenced by factors such as capital expenditure plans of customers, changes in
downstream consumption, technological upgrades, inventory adjustments in the supply
chain and general economic conditions.

During periods of economic slowdown, industry downturn or weaker end-market
demand, our customers may postpone, reduce or cancel their orders, adjust their inventory
levels or negotiate for lower prices and longer payment terms. In addition, uncertainties in
the macroeconomic environment, including inflation, interest rate changes, currency
volatility and regional or global crises, may negatively affect our customers’ business
performance and willingness to invest in new projects or products.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

RISK FACTORS

In addition, our supply chain may be subject to disruptions arising from supplier
capacity constraints, changes to customs or tariff policies, trade restrictions (including
sanctions and export controls), quality issues, logistics delays, labor disputes, natural
disasters, pandemics, regulatory restrictions or other unforeseen events. If any major
supplier fails to deliver materials or components of the required quality, quantity or
specifications on a timely basis, we may experience production delays, increased rework or
replacement costs, or challenges in meeting customer delivery schedules.

Although we adopt certain procurement and inventory management practices and may
work with multiple suppliers for certain materials, these measures may not fully insulate us
from cost volatility or supply disruptions. Any sustained increase in raw material or
component prices, or any material interruption in supply, could increase our operating
costs, reduce our margins, disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Rapid technological change in the power electronics and new energy industries requires
sustained research and development investment, and failure to maintain adequate R&D
capabilities could weaken our competitiveness.

Our ability to remain competitive depends on our capacity to keep pace with
technological developments in areas such as power conversion efficiency, energy storage,
system integration, grid-interactive capabilities, digitalisation and smart energy
management. We must ensure that our products, including high-frequency magnetic
components, smart transformer stations, data center transformers and HVDC power supply
systems, continue to meet evolving customer requirements and industry standards.

During the Track Record Period, we incurred significant R&D expenses. In 2023 and
2024, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025, our total R&D expenses
amounted to RMB185.8 million, RMB191.2 million, RMB145.7 million and RMB173.9
million, respectively. However, the growth rate of our R&D investment has lagged behind
revenue growth, and the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue has not fully recovered to prior
levels.

If our R&D investment is insufficient or not effectively allocated, product upgrades
and technological innovation may lag behind market developments. Should competitors
introduce products with higher efficiency, lower costs or superior performance, we may be
forced to reduce prices to maintain market share, which would place further pressure on our
gross margins.

Research and development activities are inherently uncertain, and there is no assurance
that our investments will result in commercially successful products. If our technological
advantages erode, we may experience loss of market share, unrecovered R&D costs and
reduced profitability, potentially creating a negative cycle of declining competitiveness and
constrained future R&D investment. Any such developments could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

RISK FACTORS

A portion of our revenue is derived from overseas markets including North America, Europe,
and Southeast Asia, exposing our export business and operations to legal, regulatory,
political, and economic risks beyond our control.

We have established subsidiaries in key overseas sales regions, including the United
States, Japan and Germany, and have gradually developed an international sales network
globally. These subsidiaries of the Company, in the opinion of the directors of the
Company, principally affected the results during the Track Record Period or formed a
substantial portion of the net assets of the Group. As a result, our export business and
overseas operations are exposed to legal, regulatory, political and economic risks beyond
our control.

These risks include trade disputes, tariff increases, trade restrictions, and differences in
regulatory and safety requirements, technical standards (such as grid interconnection and
energy efficiency requirements), customs procedures and product certification regimes
across jurisdictions. Non-compliance with applicable requirements may lead to sales delays,
penalties, market access restrictions, or the need for costly product redesigns or delayed
product launches.

In addition, geopolitical developments, changes in free trade arrangements, stricter
export controls over our products supplied to these markets, sanctions that may be imposed
against certain customers in these markets, currency fluctuations, foreign exchange
controls, restrictions on profit repatriation and differing tax regimes may adversely affect
market access, component sourcing and overall financial performance. If we are unable to
effectively manage these challenges, our international expansion, cost structure, customer
retention and growth prospects could be constrained, materially and adversely affecting our
export sales, competitiveness, business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our Group’s success depends on maintaining and expanding our customer base while
encouraging increased use of our products and services.

Our continued success depends on maintaining and expanding our customer base and
increasing customer adoption of our products and services. We emphasize customer-driven
R&D and long-term collaboration with strategic customers to support recurring demand.

However, customer engagement may decline due to factors such as dissatisfaction with
product performance, competitive pressure, macroeconomic conditions or changes in
customer strategies. If we fail to adapt to industry trends, continue innovating or maintain
strong customer relationships, customer retention and acquisition may be adversely
affected.

Any sustained decline in customer engagement could lead to lower revenue and
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

RISK FACTORS

Any shortage in key supplies or disruptions to our supply chain may have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We rely on third-party suppliers to provide materials and components used in our
production processes. In 2023, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2025,
purchases from our top five suppliers for each period during the Track Record Period
amounted to approximately RMB555.2 million, RMB694.3 million and RMB526.4 million,
representing 20.1%, 20.5% and 19.9% of our total purchase amount for such period,
respectively. The purchases from our largest supplier for each period during the Track
Record Period amounted to approximately RMB159.9 million, RMB174.6 million and
RMB147.2 million, representing 5.8%, 5.2% and 5.6% of our total purchase amount in the
same periods, respectively. Although we maintain qualified supplier records and utilize an
ERP system to support procurement planning, our operations remain dependent on the
stability, reliability and performance of these suppliers.

The timely availability and consistent quality of materials supplied by third parties are
critical to our ability to manufacture products according to schedule, maintain product
standards and meet customer delivery requirements. Any interruption, delay or shortfall in
the supply of required materials from key suppliers could disrupt our production plans and
adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders.

In addition, as our business expands globally, we procure certain materials from
overseas suppliers. Geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, export controls or changes in
customs or tariff policies may increase procurement costs, affect pricing, extend lead times
or, in certain circumstances, limit or prevent the sourcing of imported materials from
certain suppliers in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Although we seek to
mitigate such risks through supplier diversification and inventory management, these
measures may not fully offset the impact of supply chain disruptions.

Any sustained shortage of key materials or disruption to our supply chain could
increase operating costs, reduce production efficiency, delay order fulfilment and impair
customer relationships. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We operate across multiple product categories, and any failure to effectively allocate
resources among these segments may adversely affect our overall performance.

We operate across multiple product categories, including (i) transformer and power
equipment products, comprising new energy products, data center products, power
distribution products and industrial control products, (ii) lighting products, and (iii)
other products. Each of these product categories differs in terms of market dynamics,
customer requirements, competitive landscape, technological development cycles and
capital investment needs.

Our management is required to continuously allocate financial, human and operational
resources among these product segments in response to changing market conditions and
strategic priorities. However, we may not be able to accurately anticipate market trends or
appropriately balance resource allocation among these segments at all times.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

RISK FACTORS

If we fail to renew required certifications or if certifications are suspended or revoked
due to non-compliance or product defects, we may be prohibited from manufacturing,
selling or exporting the affected products. Regulatory authorities may also impose penalties
or require corrective actions.

Given the international scope of our operations, any certification-related failure could
result in operational disruptions, reputational damage and loss of market access, materially
and adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our financial results may be adversely affected by tax risks relating to our transfer pricing
arrangements.

During the Track Record Period, we conducted intra-group transactions among our
subsidiaries in PRC, the United States, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong. We
believe that we have complied with the transfer pricing laws and regulations in the relevant
jurisdictions and that these transactions adhered to the arm’s length principle under the
OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for the years 2023, and 2024 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2025. However, there can be no assurance that our arrangements will not be
challenged by tax authorities, or that the relevant laws and regulations will not be amended
or reinterpreted in the future.

If tax authorities determine that any intra-group transaction was not conducted on an
arm’s length basis, they may adjust the taxable income of the relevant entities through a
transfer pricing adjustment. This could result in the reallocation of income, the imposition
of additional tax assessments, and the levying of statutory interest or penalties. Any such
adjustment would increase our tax liabilities and overall tax burden, and may necessitate
changes to our operating or pricing practices. Failure to rectify any non-compliance within
the required timeframe could lead to further late payment interest, surcharges, or other
penalties. Additionally, tax adjustments in one jurisdiction could give rise to recoverable
taxes in another.

Adverse determinations regarding our transfer pricing could also lead to disputes,
increase our compliance costs, and divert management attention. Consequently, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected.

We rely on continuous and substantial R&D investment to strengthen our technological
capabilities, support our diversified product portfolio, and advance power electronics and
renewable energy solutions, with R&D expenses expected to remain at relatively high levels.

In 2023, 2024, and the nine months ended September 30, 2025, research and
development expenditure was RMB185.8 million (5.1% of revenue), RMB191.2 million
(4.2% of revenue), and RMB173.9 million (4.6% of revenue), respectively. Research and
development activities are inherently subject to uncertainty. Our ability to achieve
anticipated technical outcomes depends on, among other factors, the availability of
sufficient resources, including qualified personnel, as well as effective project management

RISK FACTORS

and execution. Even where technical milestones are achieved, commercialization may be
delayed or constrained by regulatory requirements, supply chain limitations, or
higher-than-expected production and implementation costs.

Given the rapid pace of technological change in our industry, there is no assurance that
our solutions can be upgraded in a timely, efficient or cost-effective manner. Technological
breakthroughs by competitors may render our existing or future technologies obsolete or
commercially unattractive, which could limit our ability to recover research and
development expenditures. As a result, our revenues, market share, profitability and cash
flows may be adversely affected.

In addition, insufficient investment in research and development, or the failure of key
development projects to achieve their intended objectives, could weaken our competitive
position. Any of the foregoing circumstances may materially and adversely affect our
market position, business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may not be able to effectively manage our distributors, and any actions taken by our
distributors in breach of the framework agreements or sales guidelines could materially and
adversely affect our business, prospects and reputation.

We have limited control over the operations and conduct of our distributors, all of
whom, to the best knowledge of our Directors, were Independent Third Parties during the
Track Record Period. We primarily rely on distribution agreements and sales guidelines to
regulate our relationships with our distributors. We have implemented certain measures to
manage our distributors, including monitoring their compliance with applicable laws, rules,
regulations and our internal policies. For details, see “Business — Sales and Marketing —
Sales through distributors” in this Document. However, we cannot assure you that we will
be able to manage our distributors effectively at all times, or that our distributors will not
breach our agreements or policies.

If any of our distributors engages in one or more of the following activities, our
business, results of operations, prospects and reputation may be materially and adversely
affected: (i) breaching the distribution agreements or our internal policies and measures; (ii)
failing to obtain or maintain the requisite licenses, permits or approvals, or failing to
comply with applicable regulatory requirements in connection with the sale, export or
transfer of our products; or (iii) violating sanctions, import and export controls, customs
requirements or other trade regulations, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, competition or other
applicable laws and regulations in the PRC or other jurisdictions.

Any breach or alleged breach by our distributors of the distribution agreements, sales
guidelines or applicable laws and regulations could result in potential legal liability incurred
by us, damage to our goodwill, a decline in the market value of our brand and adverse
public perception regarding the quality of our products, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

RISK FACTORS

We are subject to ESG laws and regulations, and any failure to comply with such requirements
may have a negative impact on our business operations.

We are subject to various ESG laws and regulations imposed by regulatory bodies,
including the Stock Exchange upon our [REDACTED], as well as regulatory authorities in
the PRC. For details, please refer to “Business” in this Document. We are required to adapt
to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable laws and changing social trends
relating to ESG risks. However, such laws, regulations and policies continue to evolve, and
investors are increasingly focusing on ESG matters and incorporating ESG performance
into their [REDACTED] decisions, while customers are becoming more environmentally
conscious and tending to prefer products designed and manufactured in a more
environmentally friendly manner.

In response, we monitor environmental- and climate-related risks that may affect our
business, strategy and financial performance, and assess the potential impact of such risks
over the short-, medium- and long-term horizons. We also monitor a range of indicators to
manage environmental and climate-related risks arising from our operations, and we are
committed to providing appropriate support to our employees in order to foster a positive
and supportive corporate culture. Our efforts to comply with new and evolving laws,
regulations and social trends relating to ESG matters may result in increased general and
administrative expenses and require management to devote additional time and attention to
compliance matters rather than operational activities, which could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Any discontinuation of preferential tax treatments or imposition of any additional taxes and
surcharges could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We enjoyed certain preferential tax treatments and export tax refunds. For example,
during the Track Record Period, our certain subsidiaries operating in the PRC were
accredited as “High and New Technology Enterprise” (“HNTE”), and were therefore
eligible for a preferential EIT rate of 15%. Certain subsidiaries were entitled to other types
of preferential tax treatments. For details, see “Financial Information — Description of
Major Components of Our Results of Operations — Income Tax Expense.” However, any
expiration or change of these preferential tax treatments could adversely affect our
operating results. We cannot assure you that the policies on preferential tax treatments and
export tax refund will remain unchanged or that the current preferential tax treatments we
enjoy will not be canceled. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will continue to enjoy
similar preferential tax treatment in the future. If any of our subsidiaries ceases to be
entitled to preferential tax treatment, it may lead to an adverse effect to our results of
operations.

Our products are deployed in critical infrastructure applications, and any safety or quality
failure could materially damage our reputation and financial performance.

Our products, including transformers, LED drivers and related components, are used
in critical infrastructure such as power grids, data centers and renewable energy systems,
where safety, reliability and operational stability are essential. Accidents may occur during
the course of business. In addition to claims arising from accidents, we may also experience


-----

RISK FACTORS

interruptions to our business as a result of governmental investigations or the
implementation of safety measures upon occurrence of accidents. For details, please refer
“Business — Environmental, Social and Governance — 5.3 Employee Health & Safety” of
this Document.

If our products fail to meet applicable safety standards or regulatory requirements, we
may be required to initiate recalls, implement corrective measures or face product liability
claims. Product issues may arise from components such as insulation materials, power
semiconductor modules, control systems or magnetic components, and the direct costs of
remediation may not always be fully recoverable from suppliers.

In addition to direct costs, product defects or recalls may result in indirect
consequences, including production disruptions, increased warranty claims, adverse
publicity, loss of customer confidence and potential regulatory actions. Even perceived
quality issues could negatively affect our reputation. Any significant product quality failure
could materially impair our brand, customer relationships and market position, thereby
materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from LED driver products, and the increasing
commoditization of the LED driver market may adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of LED driver products.
The LED driver market is highly competitive and has become increasingly commoditized
due to rapid technological diffusion, standardization of product specifications and the
presence of numerous domestic and international competitors. As a result, LED driver
products are often subject to intense price competition.

In addition, industry-wide capacity expansion and relatively low barriers to entry may
result in oversupply in the LED driver market from time to time. Such oversupply may
further intensify price pressure and limit our ability to pass on increases in raw material,
labor and other production costs to our customers. As competition increases and product
differentiation becomes more difficult to maintain, we may be required to lower our selling
prices, offer more favorable commercial terms or incur additional marketing and sales
expenses to maintain or expand our market share.

If we are unable to effectively differentiate our LED driver products, improve
operational efficiency or manage pricing pressure, our gross margins and profitability may
be adversely affected. Consequently, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected.

RISK FACTORS

We depend on our key management and technical personnel, and the loss of any of them could
adversely affect us.

Our success depends to a significant extent on the experience, expertise and continued
service of our key management, technical and engineering personnel. These individuals
possess a deep understanding of our business, products, technologies, customer
relationships and operational processes, and have played an important role in
formulating and executing our strategies, managing our operations and driving our
product development.

Competition for qualified management and technical personnel in our industry is
intense. If any of our key personnel resigns, retires or otherwise ceases to work for us, we
may not be able to recruit or retain suitable replacements in a timely manner or on
commercially reasonable terms. The integration of new personnel may also take time and
may not be successful. In addition, the loss of key personnel could disrupt our operations,
affect our relationships with customers, suppliers and other business partners, and result in
the loss of institutional knowledge and technical know-how.

Although we have implemented certain human resources policies and incentive
schemes, there is no assurance that we will be able to retain our key personnel or attract
new talent as needed. Any significant loss of key management or technical personnel, or
failure to effectively recruit, develop and retain qualified personnel, could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Our Single Largest Shareholders Group may cease to be our single largest shareholders group
in case of default of his obligations under a bona fide commercial loan, which could have a
negative impact on the control of Mr. Xiao in the operations of the Company and in turn our
business, operation and financial results.

As of Latest Practicable Date, in order to obtain financing for his personal needs, Mr.
Xiao has from time to time pledged the A Shares he owned directly or indirectly to certain
PRC financial institutions as collateral. As of the Latest Practicable Date, Mr. Xiao has
pledged 12.9% of the voting power of our Company as security in favor of certain PRC
financial institutions regulated by the NAFR and/or the CSRC. For further details of the
pledge arrangements, see “Single Largest Shareholders Group — Share Pledges by Mr.
Xiao.”

In the unlikely event of default by Mr. Xiao and MegaMax under the said bona fide
commercial loan(s), the lenders can enforce the share pledge arrangement and Mr. Xiao and
MegaMax may cease to be a member of the single largest shareholder group, which could
have a negative impact on the control of Mr. Xiao in the operations of the Company and in
turn our business, operation and financial results.

RISK FACTORS

We are actively expanding into new energy products as part of our growth strategy, but this
new segment exposes us to risks due to rapid technological changes.

One of our key new energy products is “High Frequency Magnetic Components”,
which serve as critical functional components in PV inverters, new energy vehicles, charging
piles, and energy storage systems. High Frequency Magnetic Components are PV-related
products operating at frequencies above approximately 1 kHz and rely on specialized
magnetic core materials, winding structures and high power-density designs. Our product
development and design processes incorporate dedicated high-frequency magnetic core
materials and optimized winding structures, with designs intended to deliver heat resistance,
anti-aging performance and operational reliability for long-term use in high-reliability
scenarios.

However, the power electronics industry is characterized by rapid technological
evolution in areas such as system architecture, materials science and system integration.
Continuous advances in these areas may necessitate frequent product iteration and
redesign. There is no assurance that our existing or future designs will remain competitive
as technologies evolve, and certain designs may become less attractive or obsolete over time.
Any failure to keep pace with technological developments could weaken the competitiveness
of our products and adversely affect our market position.

We rely on a limited number of major customers and any reduction in orders from these
customers could adversely affect us.

A portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of major customers. In
particular, sales to a single major customer amounted to RMB1,554.4 million in 2023,
RMB1,623.7 million in 2024 and RMB1,018.9 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2025. In addition, the aggregate revenue attributable to our top five customers
amounted to RMB2,041.0 million in 2023, RMB2,403.2 million in 2024 and RMB1,684.7
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The relatively high contribution
from a limited number of customers indicates a certain degree of customer concentration,
which exposes us to heightened risks associated with fluctuations in demand, purchasing
decisions and creditworthiness of these major customers. As a result, any adverse change in
the business relationship with one or more key customers could have a disproportionate
impact on our revenue and operating performance.

These customers may, from time to time, experience changes in their own business
strategies, procurement policies, product road-maps or financial conditions, which could in
turn affect their demand for our products. Our sales to any particular customer may vary
significantly from year to year and there is no assurance that such customers will maintain
or increase their level of purchases from us in the future.

Our major customers may reduce their orders, delay deliveries, request price
reductions, change their suppliers, or terminate cooperation with us for various reasons,
including their own market performance, internal supply chain optimization, strategic
adjustments or competitive offers from other suppliers. In addition, if we fail to meet their
quality, delivery, cost or technology requirements, they may reduce their reliance on us or
cease to source from us.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

RISK FACTORS

If we lose one or more major customers, or if any such customer significantly reduces
its orders or fails to make timely payments, we may not be able to quickly replace the lost
business with new customers or orders on comparable terms.

Limitations or disruptions in our customer acquisition channels could adversely affect our
revenue growth.

We rely on a combination of reactive and proactive customer acquisition channels,
including international trade fairs, exhibitions, customer referrals and targeted outreach by
our business development teams. Reactive channels have historically played an important
role in generating exposure and customer engagement.

Factors beyond our control, such as public health incidents, geopolitical tensions or
budget constraints, may limit our ability to participate in exhibitions or trade fairs.
Alternative channels may not provide equivalent exposure or cost efficiency.

Sustained limitations on our marketing and customer acquisition channels could
weaken market visibility, delay product promotion and increase customer acquisition costs,
thereby materially and adversely affecting our revenue growth and business performance.

Our success depends significantly on protecting our proprietary technologies, products, and
solutions through intellectual property rights, including patents, software copyrights,
registered trademarks, and domain names filed in China and overseas jurisdictions.

Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies,
products and solutions through intellectual property rights, including patents, software
copyrights, registered trademarks and domain names in the PRC and overseas jurisdictions.
As of September 30, 2025, we held 47 registered trademarks, 542 patents and 51 copyrights
in the PRC.

The process of applying for, prosecuting and maintaining intellectual property rights is
time-consuming and costly. We may fail to timely identify patentable aspects of our
research and development activities, or to file and prosecute all necessary applications in a
cost-effective manner. Even where patents are granted, they may provide only limited
protection, as competitors may design non-infringing alternatives, challenge the validity or
enforceability of our intellectual property rights, or benefit from the expiration of such
rights after their statutory terms. In addition, ongoing compliance with procedural
requirements, such as responses to office actions and payment of maintenance fees, is
required to maintain intellectual property rights, and any failure to comply could result in
lapse or abandonment.

If our intellectual property rights are compromised, competitors may be able to
replicate or compete more effectively with our products, eroding our market position.
Furthermore, we may be subject to infringement claims by third parties, which are not
uncommon in our industry. Such claims, whether or not ultimately successful, could result
in costly litigation, product redesigns, sales suspensions or unfavorable licensing

RISK FACTORS

Our Group is undertaking digital transformation initiatives and relies on information
technology systems for daily operations, including internal communications, customer data
management, product development, project management, and production processes.

Our information technology systems, including those supporting our production
management, supply chain coordination, financial reporting and internal communications,
are subject to risks such as hardware and software failures, system defects, viruses,
cyber-attacks, ransomware incidents and other security breaches. These systems also rely on
stable power supply and network connectivity, which are susceptible to failures or
disruptions beyond our control.

Any material disruption, breakdown or breach of our IT systems, whether caused by
internal errors, third-party service failures, malicious attacks or external events such as
natural disasters, could result in the loss, corruption, unauthorized disclosure or
unavailability of critical data. System failures or prolonged downtime could impede our
ability to manage production schedules, track inventory, process customer orders, issue
invoices or perform financial and management reporting on a timely basis. In addition, any
actual or perceived compromise of data security, including the unauthorized access, use or
disclosure of confidential or personal information, could damage our reputation and expose
us to potential disputes or regulatory actions.

Although we maintain certain backup systems, security measures and contingency
plans, these measures may be insufficient to prevent or fully mitigate all types of incidents,
particularly as cyber-security threats continue to evolve in frequency, complexity and
sophistication. If any of the foregoing events were to occur, our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

Our Group’s market reputation benefits from certifications, rankings, and awards from
reputable industry associations.

Our Group’s market reputation is supported in part by certifications, recognitions and
memberships awarded by industry organizations and third-party institutions, as well as by
our participation in industry associations. These certifications and recognitions may be
considered by our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders when assessing our
credibility, product quality and competitiveness.

However, the maintenance, renewal or upgrading of such certifications and
recognitions is not assured. They typically require us to comply with specific standards
and to undergo periodic reviews, audits or assessments. If we fail to meet relevant criteria,
experience quality issues, or are unable to allocate sufficient resources to maintain these
qualifications, we may lose certain certifications or fail to obtain new recognitions in a
timely manner. In addition, changes in industry standards, assessment methodologies or
regulatory requirements could make it more difficult or costly for us to maintain or obtain
such recognitions.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

RISK FACTORS

The loss of key certifications or reputational recognitions, or any negative evaluation
by industry organizations or associations, could adversely affect our perceived reliability
and competitiveness in the market, and could in turn reduce customer confidence in our
products and services. Any such development could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Defects or unsatisfactory performance of our products, or failure to maintain effective quality
control, could result in returns, recalls, reputational damage, loss of customers and product
operations.

Defects or unsatisfactory performance of our products, or failures in our quality
control processes, could result in product malfunctions, reduced efficiency or
shorter-than-expected service life. Although we have implemented quality management
systems and testing procedures across our production processes, we cannot assure that all
defects will be detected and remedied before our products are delivered to customers or
integrated into their end-products or systems.

Defective products or components may give rise to returns, replacements, repairs,
product recalls, contractual penalties or warranty claims, which could increase our costs
and negatively affect our profitability. In certain circumstances, product quality issues may
also delay customer projects, disrupt their operations or cause them to switch to other
suppliers. Furthermore, if our products cause or are alleged to have caused property
damage, personal injury or other losses, we may be exposed to claims or disputes that could
result in additional costs and divert management attention.

Any material quality issues or product failures, particularly if they affect key
customers, could damage our reputation for reliability and performance, reduce customer
satisfaction and impair our ability to win new orders or renew existing business. As a result,
our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected.

We may be subject to impact of our risk management and internal control systems in the
future.

We have designed and implemented comprehensive risk management and internal
control policies and procedures to monitor and control potential risk exposures relevant to
our business operations. This framework is overseen by designated internal personnel,
supported by independent internal control consultants and external compliance advisors, to
monitor and mitigate risks relevant to our business operations. While we seek to improve
our risk management and internal control systems on a continuous basis, we cannot
guarantee that these systems will be sufficiently effective in identifying, managing and
preventing all potential risks that may arise from our business operations. If our internal
control system fails to detect potential risks in our business, as intended, or is otherwise
subject to weaknesses and deficiencies, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

RISK FACTORS

Our risk management and internal controls systems also require effective
implementation by our employees. There can be no assurance that such implementation
by our employees will always function as intended or that such implementation will not
involve any human errors, mistakes or intentional misconduct. If we fail to implement our
policies and procedures in a timely manner or fail to identify risks that affect our business
with sufficient time to plan for contingencies for such events, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We are subject to a range of laws, regulations and regulatory standards, and any failure to
comply with these requirements may expose us to liabilities.

We are subject to extensive laws, regulations and regulatory requirements in the PRC
and other jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, and any failure to comply with
such requirements may subject us to liabilities and penalties. For example, we are required
to comply with various labor-related laws and regulations in the PRC, including those
relating to social insurance and housing provident fund contributions for our employees.

Under the relevant PRC laws and regulations, including the Regulation on the
Administration of Housing Provident Funds and the PRC Social Insurance Law, PRC
enterprises are required to establish housing provident fund accounts for their employees,
complete social insurance registration and make contributions to social insurance and
housing provident fund in a timely and full manner. Although we were not subject to any
material administrative penalties imposed by the relevant authorities in connection with our
social insurance and housing provident fund contributions during the Track Record Period,
there can be no assurance that our historical and current practices in this regard will always
be regarded as fully compliant by the relevant regulatory authorities, particularly in light of
the evolving interpretation, application and enforcement of the relevant laws and
regulations.

In the event that our practices are determined to be non-compliant, we may be required
to make up any shortfall in social insurance and housing provident fund contributions
within a prescribed time period and may be subject to administrative penalties if we fail to
rectify such non-compliance in accordance with the requirements of the relevant authorities.
During the Track Record Period, we had not received any administrative order to rectify
our practices comprehensively or to pay up any shortfall all at once or subject to any
material administrative penalty imposed by the relevant regulatory authorities regarding
PRC social insurance and housing provident funds. Considering relevant regulator policies
and the facts stated above provided that there are no material changes to the current social
insurance, housing provident fund policies and regulations, or to the enforcement and
supervision requirements of local governments and in the absence of collective employee
complaints or litigation or arbitrations, our PRC Legal Advisor is of the view that the
likelihood that we would be required by relevant regulatory authorities to pay up any
shortfall all at once for social insurance and housing provident fund contribution or become
subject to material administrative penalties by relevant authorities is remote.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure by us to comply with other applicable labor
laws and regulations in the PRC may also expose us to liabilities, penalties or claims for
compensation by employees.

RISK FACTORS

We may experience inventory impairment, shortages or excess inventory, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025,
our inventories amounted to RMB483.8 million, RMB734.0 million and RMB798.9 million,
respectively. Over the same periods, our inventory turnover days increased from
approximately 54.0 days in 2023 to 59.6 days in 2024 and further to 66.8 days for the
nine months ended September 30, 2025. The continuous increase in both inventory balances
and inventory turnover days indicates rising inventory holding pressure and reflects the risk
of slower-moving or unsold products amid changes in market demand.

As of September 30, 2025, inventories of RMB798.9 million accounted for
approximately 342.3% of our net cash flows from operating activities of RMB233.4
million for the same period, resulting in significant occupation of working capital. Such
elevated inventory levels increase our exposure to fluctuations in market demand, pricing
pressure and product obsolescence, particularly in an environment characterized by rapid
technological iteration and cyclical investment patterns in the renewable energy and power
infrastructure sectors.

If market demand weakens further or if downstream investment continues to slow, the
net realizable value of our inventories may fall materially below their carrying costs, which
could require us to recognize substantial inventory write-downs or impairment losses. Any
such impairment would directly reduce our gross profit and net profit, adversely affect our
asset quality and leverage ratios, and may weaken our ability to obtain external financing
on favorable terms. In addition, excess or obsolete inventory may constrain our operational
flexibility and negatively affect our liquidity position, thereby materially and adversely
affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our
financial performance.

We are exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from transactions, investments and
financing activities denominated in currencies other than Renminbi. As of September 30,
2025, our cash and cash equivalents included balances denominated in U.S. dollars of
RMB500.3 million, euros of RMB37.8 million and Japanese yen of RMB20.0 million.

Such fluctuations indicate that our financial results are highly sensitive to movements
in foreign exchange rates. In particular, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S.
dollar and other foreign currencies may weaken the price competitiveness of our products in
overseas markets, while depreciation of the Renminbi may increase the costs of raw
materials, components and operating expenses sourced from overseas suppliers. Moreover,
although a substantial portion of our overseas subsidiaries’ operating costs are
denominated in local currencies, part of their revenues are settled in U.S. dollars, further
amplifying the impact of currency mismatches on our consolidated results.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

RISK FACTORS

We currently do not maintain comprehensive or effective hedging arrangements to
mitigate such foreign exchange risks. If exchange rate volatility persists or intensifies, we
may experience significant fluctuations in reported earnings, cash flows and equity. Such
volatility could impair [REDACTED] ability to accurately forecast our performance,
adversely affect market confidence, and negatively impact the valuation of our H Shares
and our ability to raise capital in the future, thereby materially and adversely affecting our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain projects regarding our new energy products require significant upfront capital
commitments and are characterized by extended construction and development timelines. If we
fail to exercise sound judgment in project selection or to implement effective risk management
measures, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected.

In particular, the development and operation of these projects often necessitate
substantial financial and operational resources in their initial stages. The timely completion
and successful execution of such projects depend on various factors beyond our control,
including obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, prevailing climate conditions and the
stability of supply chains. Any delays, interruptions or adverse changes in these factors may
lead to increased costs, construction delays or project suspension or termination, which
could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, the capital-intensive nature and extended payback periods of these projects may
place pressure on our liquidity and profitability. There can be no assurance that we will
consistently and accurately evaluate project feasibility, effectively manage construction and
operational risks, or promptly adapt to evolving market conditions, and any failure to do so
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Insufficient returns on investment and research and development may lead to declining
profitability and erosion of retained earnings.

Our research and development expenses amounted to RMB185.8 million in 2023,
RMB191.2 million in 2024 and RMB173.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2025, representing a relatively modest growth rate compared to our revenue growth. In
particular, the increase in R&D expenditure from 2023 to 2024 was approximately 2.9%,
significantly lower than the revenue growth of approximately 27.3% during the same
period, indicating declining R&D intensity.

As of September 30, 2025, our retained earnings amounted to only RMB833.8 million,
representing a marginal increase compared to RMB792.1 million as of December 31, 2024.
Continued pressure on profitability may constrain our ability to reinvest in technology
development, weaken our equity base and increase the difficulty and cost of future equity
financing. If we are unable to enhance R&D effectiveness and generate sustainable returns
on our investments, our long-term growth prospects, financial resilience and shareholder
value may be materially and adversely affected.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

RISK FACTORS

We may experience an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as a result of
geopolitical developments.

Our business is exposed to geopolitical risks and other external factors, including trade
tensions and tariff policies. For example, the recent trade frictions between China and the
United States have led to (amongst others) increased tariffs imposed by the United States
on Chinese-origin goods, affecting the certain lighting products of the Group that are of a
Chinese origin, thereby constraining revenue growth and reducing competitiveness in
export markets.

Any further escalation of geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, tariff increases, cost
inflation or overseas market pressure could further compress margins, limit revenue growth
and increase earnings volatility. Such developments may impair investor confidence,
adversely affect our valuation in the capital markets and materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our ongoing establishment of overseas bases exposes us to a slowdown in overall profit growth
that could exert a negative impact on our business performance.

Our ongoing establishment and expansion of overseas production bases and operating
platforms are intended to enhance our global presence, serve local customers more
effectively and optimize our supply chain. However, these initiatives expose us to additional
risks and uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and jurisdictions.

The construction, ramp-up and operation of overseas bases may encounter delays, cost
overruns, regulatory or licensing hurdles, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages or
difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified local personnel. In addition, we may face
unfamiliar legal, tax, regulatory and business environments, as well as cultural and
language differences, which could complicate our management and oversight of these bases.
The utilization rates and profitability of new overseas facilities, particularly during their
initial ramp-up periods, may be lower than expected and may take longer to reach optimal
levels.

Moreover, geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs, exchange rate
volatility or other external factors could adversely affect the economics of operating
overseas bases or our ability to move products and components across borders. Any
material adverse development affecting our overseas bases could increase our costs, reduce
our operational flexibility and negatively affect our overall business performance, financial
condition and results of operations.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

RISK FACTORS

Our ongoing capital investment needs expose us to risks of cost overruns and financing
shortfalls that could materially and adversely affect our business.

Our Group requires continuous and significant capital investments to expand and
upgrade our production facilities, introduce new equipment, enhance automation and
improve product quality and compliance with evolving technical standards. The scale and
timing of our capital expenditures are influenced by our business plans, customer demand,
technology trends and regulatory requirements, and may fluctuate significantly from period
to period.

We may not always be able to accurately forecast the required level or timing of capital
investments. If we invest in additional capacity or new technologies based on overly
optimistic demand expectations, we may experience under-utilization of facilities, lower
returns on investment and increased depreciation and financing costs. Conversely, if we
under-invest or delay necessary capital projects, we may be unable to meet customer
demand, risk falling behind competitors in technology and efficiency, or face higher
maintenance and repair costs for aging equipment.

To fund capital expenditures, we may need to rely on internally generated cash flows,
bank borrowings or other external financing. There can be no assurance that such financing
will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Increased leverage could, in turn,
increase our interest expenses and subject us to restrictive covenants that limit our
operational and financial flexibility. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We may fail to collect trade receivables, prepayments, and other amounts due, materially and
adversely affecting our liquidity and financial condition.

We extend credit terms to our customers in the ordinary course of business and, in
some cases, make prepayments or advances to suppliers and other counterparties. As a
result, we are exposed to the risk that trade receivables, prepayments and other amounts
due to us may not be collected in full or on a timely basis. The substantial increase in trade
receivables indicates a higher proportion of sales conducted on credit and a longer cash
conversion cycle, which in turn heightens our exposure to customer credit risk and
collection uncertainty. As our receivables balance grows, any deterioration in customers’
payment behavior or creditworthiness could have a more pronounced impact on our cash
flows and financial position, and we may face increased risks of delayed collection,
impairment or bad debt losses.

The ability of our customers and counterparties to meet their payment obligations may
be affected by their own business performance, financial condition, cash flow management
and access to funding, as well as broader macroeconomic and industry conditions. If any
major customer or a significant number of customers experience financial difficulties, delay
payments, default on their obligations or become insolvent, we may have to extend payment
terms, restructure receivables, recognize impairment losses or write off bad debts. Similarly,
if suppliers or other counterparties fail to perform their obligations after receiving
prepayments or deposits from us, we may face difficulties in recovering such amounts or
obtaining alternative supplies on comparable terms.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

RISK FACTORS

Although we have implemented credit risk management policies, including customer
credit reviews, overdue monitoring and collection procedures, these measures may not be
sufficient to eliminate collection risks. Any significant delays or defaults in the collection of
trade receivables, prepayments and other amounts due could adversely affect our cash
flows, liquidity position, working capital management and overall financial condition.

Our leased overseas facilities expose us to legal, regulatory, and operational risks that could
disrupt production and materially and adversely affect our business.

Our Group operates a mix of owned and leased manufacturing facilities, including
certain overseas plants that we lease from third-party landlords. The operation of these
leased overseas facilities exposes us to a range of legal, regulatory and operational risks
associated with local property, environmental, labor and safety requirements in the relevant
jurisdictions. We may be unfamiliar with certain local practices, enforcement standards or
dispute resolution mechanisms, which may increase our compliance and legal risks.

Our ability to continue using these leased facilities depends on the validity and
enforceability of the underlying lease agreements and on our landlords’ willingness and
ability to honor their contractual obligations. If any landlord fails to properly maintain the
premises, breaches the lease terms, refuses to renew the lease upon expiry on terms
acceptable to us, or becomes involved in disputes, insolvency or governmental enforcement
actions, our operations at the relevant site could be disrupted or suspended. In addition, if
our use of the leased properties is challenged by governmental authorities or third parties
on the grounds of zoning, title defects, construction irregularities or non-compliance with
local regulations, we could be required to incur additional costs for rectification, relocation
or obtaining supplementary approvals.

The establishment and ramp-up of new overseas leased facilities may also experience
delays, higher-than-expected costs or lower utilization rates during the initial periods. Any
material disruption of operations at these leased overseas facilities, or any failure to secure
suitable alternative sites in a timely manner, could adversely affect our production capacity,
delivery schedules, customer relationships and cost structure. As a result, our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely
affected.

Discontinuation of government grants or preferential tax treatments could materially increase
our costs and adversely affect our business.

Our Group has historically benefited from various government grants, interest income,
with aggregate grants amounting to RMB44.2 million in 2023, RMB59.9 million in 2024,
and RMB55.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, which have
contributed positively to our financial performance. These include, among others,
government grants related to industrial development, technological innovation and
employment support, as well as preferential tax rates or tax incentives granted to eligible
enterprises. The availability and amount of such grants and preferential treatments depend
on applicable government policies, our qualification status and the authorities’ review and
approval.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

RISK FACTORS

There can be no assurance that we will continue to receive government grants or enjoy
preferential tax treatments at the same levels or on the same terms as in the past, or at all.
Relevant policies may be revised, suspended or terminated by government authorities, or we
may fail to maintain the necessary qualifications or comply with the conditions attached to
such benefits. In addition, certain grants may be subject to claw-backs or refunds if the
underlying conditions are not fulfilled or if the authorities determine that they were not
properly obtained or used.

If government grants are reduced or discontinued, or if preferential tax treatments
cease to be available or are significantly curtailed, our effective tax rate could increase and
we may incur higher operating costs. Any such changes could reduce our profitability and
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We may have limited insurance coverage, which could expose us to additional costs.

We maintain a range of insurance policies, including property, liability, product
liability, business interruption, and directors’ and officers’ insurance, which we believe
cover the major risks associated with our operations. However, there can be no assurance
that our insurance coverage is sufficient to cover all potential risks or to fully compensate
us for actual losses incurred. For example, losses arising from natural disasters, industrial
accidents, cyberattacks, or product defects may exceed policy limits or fall outside the scope
of coverage. In addition, certain high-cost or complex claims may not be fully reimbursed
by insurers, and claims processes may be delayed or contested. If we incur substantial
uninsured losses or liabilities, we could face significant financial costs and diversion of
management attention and resources from our core operations. Moreover, any increase in
premiums or inability to renew coverage at current levels could increase operating costs and
reduce our financial flexibility. These factors could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

We are subject to risks associated with third-party payment arrangements.

During the Track Record Period, certain of our customers settled payments to us
through third-party payors (the “Third-Party Payment Arrangements”). During the Track
Record Period, the aggregate amount of payments received through such Third-Party
Payment Arrangements accounted for 0.3%, 0.3% and 0.1% of the total revenue. For
further details, see “Business — Third-Party Payments” in this Document.

Notwithstanding the immaterial proportion involved, we were subject to various risks
relating to such Third-Party Payment Arrangements during the Track Record Period,
including, among others, potential claims by third-party payors for the return of funds on
the basis that they were not contractually indebted to us, as well as possible claims from
liquidators or administrators of such third-party payors. In the event that any claims are
made by third-party payors or their liquidators, or if any legal proceedings (whether civil or
criminal) are instituted or brought against us in connection with third-party payments, we
may be required to devote significant financial and management resources to defend against
such claims or proceedings. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations
could be affected.

RISK FACTORS

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS IN THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE
OPERATE

Changes in economic, political, and regulatory conditions across our operating jurisdictions
could materially and adversely affect our business.

Our Group operates in multiple jurisdictions and is exposed to market, business, and
financial risks arising from geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic instability, foreign
currency fluctuations, and interest rate volatility. For example, appreciation of the RMB
against the USD, EUR, or JPY could weaken our pricing competitiveness in overseas
markets, while depreciation may increase procurement costs for imported components.
Regulatory differences across jurisdictions, such as safety and environmental standards,
also increase operational complexity and compliance costs. Such economic and regulatory
uncertainties could materially impair our growth strategy, disrupt operations, and adversely
affect our financial performance, business, and results of operations.

In addition, certain jurisdictions in which we operate have imposed or may impose
sanctions, export controls, or other trade restrictions against certain countries, individuals
and legal entities that have the effect of prohibiting or restricting certain business dealings
and activities with such countries, individuals and/or legal entities. Sanctions and export
control laws or regulations could change in a way that could affect our business, exports or
sales activities and/or could result in investigations, penalties or fines. Changes in trade
policies, tariffs, or local market regulations could therefore disrupt supply chains, reduce
revenue, or limit market access.

Our operations are subject to cybersecurity, data privacy and personal information protection
risks, and any non-compliance or security incident could adversely affect us.

We rely on information technology systems to support our business operations,
including production management, supply chain coordination, financial reporting and
internal communications. In the course of our business, we may collect, process and store
certain data, which may include business-sensitive information and limited personal
information of employees and business contacts, subject to applicable cybersecurity, data
privacy and personal information protection laws and regulations.

The regulatory framework governing cybersecurity and data protection in the PRC and
other jurisdictions where we operate is evolving and becoming increasingly stringent. We
are required to comply with various requirements relating to data classification, storage,
transmission, cross-border transfer, security assessments and incident reporting. Any
failure to establish and maintain appropriate policies, systems and controls, or any
misinterpretation of applicable requirements, could result in non-compliance with the
relevant laws and regulations.

RISK FACTORS

Our IT systems and data may also be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, hacking, phishing,
malware, ransomware, unauthorized access, misuse or other security incidents. Any actual
or suspected data breach or loss, or any material disruption to our IT systems, could result
in business interruptions, loss of data, increased recovery costs, reputational damage and
potential regulatory inquiries or penalties. Although we have taken certain information
security measures, such measures may not be sufficient to prevent or fully mitigate all such
risks. If any of the foregoing events occurs, our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

We may be subject to additional regulatory requirements under new laws and regulations on
overseas [REDACTED] and listings issued by PRC government authorities.

On July 6, 2021, the relevant PRC government authorities issued the Opinions on
Strictly Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities in Accordance with the Law (《關於依法
從嚴打擊證券活動的意見》). These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the
administration of illegal securities activities and the supervision of overseas listings by
China-based companies and proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the
construction of relevant regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents faced by
China-based overseas-listed companies. See “Regulatory Overview — Regulations on
Securities and Filing for Overseas Listing”.

On February 24, 2023, the CSRC, the MOF, the National Administration of State
Secrets Protection of China, and the National Archives Administration of China published
the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas
Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (《關於加強境內企業境外發行證券
和上市相關保密和檔案管理工作的規定》) (the “Archives Rules”), which came into effect on
March 31, 2023. The Archives Rules require that, in relation to the overseas securities
offering and listing activities of domestic enterprises, either in direct or indirect form, such
domestic enterprises, as well as securities companies and securities service institutions
providing relevant securities services, are required to strictly comply with relevant
requirements on confidentiality and archives management, establish a sound
confidentiality and archives system, and take necessary measures to implement their
confidentiality and archives management responsibilities. The interpretation and
implementation of the Archives Rules may continue to evolve, failure to comply with
these rules may materially affect our business, results of operations or financial conditions.

Changes in international trade policies, geopolitical developments, trade protection measures,
export controls and economic or trade sanctions may materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

As we conduct business across multiple jurisdictions, our operations are subject to
evolving international trade policies, geopolitical developments and trade protection
measures, including tariffs, export and import controls, economic or trade sanctions and
other regulatory restrictions. In recent years, heightened geopolitical tensions and national
security considerations have led to increased uncertainty and volatility in global trade
environments.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

RISK FACTORS

The scope, interpretation and enforcement of applicable trade laws and regulations
may change from time to time, and new restrictions or compliance requirements may be
imposed on cross-border transactions, technology transfers, sourcing activities or market
access. Any such changes may increase our compliance costs, disrupt our supply chain,
restrict our ability to serve certain customers or markets, or otherwise adversely affect our
business operations.

In addition, the imposition of export control measures or economic or trade sanctions,
whether directly targeting us or indirectly affecting our suppliers, customers or business
partners, could limit our access to certain products, technologies or components, reduce
demand for our products, or impair our ability to conduct cross-border business. During
the Track Record Period, the Group’s products were supplied to downstream industrial end
customers, a majority of whom were based in the PRC, with a smaller proportion in
jurisdictions across regions such as North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. It is
possible that (i) any of our products may become subject to export controls or trade
restrictions, (ii) our customers may become sanctioned, (iii) the materials and components
needed for our operations may become subject to export controls, import controls, or other
trade restrictions, or (iv) our suppliers may become subject to sanctions, thereby affecting
our ability to source our inputs, manufacture our products, and/or supply to our customers
in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, as we are looking to
expand our business in other jurisdictions, our ability to do so would also depend on the
scope and applicability of any relevant trade controls or restrictions. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to timely anticipate, fully mitigate or effectively manage all such risks.
As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
and adversely affected.

Policies on foreign investment in the PRC and other jurisdictions where we operate may
adversely affect our business and results of operations.

As we conduct business in the PRC and expand into overseas markets, we are subject
to foreign investment laws, regulations and policies in the PRC and in other jurisdictions in
which we operate or seek to expand. These laws and regulations may govern, among other
things, market entry requirements, ownership structures, approval, filing or licensing
procedures, ongoing compliance obligations and restrictions on foreign investment
activities.

Foreign investment policies, regulations and their interpretation and enforcement may
change from time to time and may differ significantly across jurisdictions. In recent years,
heightened geopolitical tensions and national security considerations have led to increased
scrutiny of foreign investment, more restrictive investment review regimes and greater
regulatory uncertainty in certain countries and regions. Such developments may result in
additional regulatory approvals, restrictions, conditions or compliance requirements being
imposed on our existing operations or future expansion plans.

Any tightening of foreign investment policies or adverse changes in applicable laws and
regulations could restrict our ability to invest in, expand or restructure our business in the
PRC or overseas markets, increase our compliance costs, delay or prevent the
implementation of our business strategies, or limit our access to certain markets. In
addition, any failure to comply with applicable foreign investment laws and regulations may
expose us to penalties, fines, remedial measures or reputational damage.

RISK FACTORS

We cannot assure you that future changes in foreign investment policies or regulatory
environments in the PRC or other jurisdictions will not adversely affect our business
operations. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected.

Our Group’s operations face risks from changes in diplomatic and international trade
relationships which could adversely affect our business.

Our business is influenced by global macroeconomic conditions and the international
trade environment. Changing trade relations between China and certain other countries or
regions that may result in an unfavorable imposition or expansion of tariffs, trade barriers,
investment restrictions, sanctions, export controls or other trade restrictions may adversely
affect our cross-border trade and investment flows.

In recent years, the U.S. in particular has imposed sanctions and export controls
measures that directly or indirectly affect PRC companies. These regulatory measures are
subject to frequent changes, depending on the prevailing national security and foreign
policy objectives that drive them. Accordingly, the implementation and enforcement of
these regulatory changes in sanctions and export controls involve substantial uncertainties
which may be beyond our control. BIS for example maintains the Entity List, which is a list
of persons that are subject to heightened export control restrictions. The U.S. in recent
years has also placed an increasing number of PRC entities on the Entity List and other
restricted party lists. Similar restrictions may also be imposed by other jurisdictions in the
future.

Such measures could increase our costs of or restrict us from exporting products to, or
importing components and equipment from, affected markets, or limit our ability to serve
customers or source supplies in certain jurisdictions. Our overseas sales and operations may
also be impacted by changes in customer procurement policies, localization requirements or
supply chain restructuring driven by geopolitical considerations.

These rapidly evolving restrictions also mean that we will need to maintain heightened
internal controls to ensure ongoing monitoring for compliance with such restrictions, which
requires significant resources.

In addition, heightened geopolitical tensions may lead to volatility in currency
exchange rates, commodity prices and financial markets, which could indirectly affect our
business performance.

If geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions or related measures continue or intensify, our
revenue growth, profitability and expansion plans in certain markets may be adversely
affected. Any material adverse change in the international trade environment could
negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Non-PRC holders of our H Shares may be subject to PRC income tax on dividends from us or
on any gain realized on the transfer of our H Shares.

Under current PRC tax laws and regulations, non-resident enterprise and individual
holders of our H Shares may, in certain circumstances, be subject to PRC income tax on

RISK FACTORS

depending on factors such as their tax residency status, the existence of applicable tax
treaties or arrangements, and the interpretation and enforcement of relevant tax rules by
PRC tax authorities.

The PRC tax treatment applicable to non-PRC holders of our H Shares may be subject
to changes in laws, regulations, tax treaties or administrative practices. There can be no
assurance that the current tax treatment will remain unchanged, or that the PRC tax
authorities will not adopt different interpretations or enforcement approaches in the future.
Any increase in PRC tax liabilities, or any uncertainty or inconsistency in the application of
tax rules, could affect the net returns received by non-PRC investors from their

[REDACTED] in our H Shares.

Potential [REDACTED] are advised to consult their own tax advisors regarding the
PRC and other tax consequences of holding and disposing of our H Shares. Any adverse
change in applicable tax treatment could negatively affect [REDACTED] returns and, in
turn, our ability to attract and retain non-PRC shareholders.

Uncertainties in serving legal process and enforcing judgments against us and our key
personnel could materially hinder remedies and adversely affect our business.

Our operations span jurisdictions with evolving legal systems where recently enacted
laws may not fully address commercial activities. Local courts may apply statutory
provisions or contract terms inconsistently, reject judgments, or interpret regulations
retroactively. Administrative and regulatory authorities may also exercise discretion in
ways that complicate legal recourse. For example, our Group or key personnel could face
lawsuits in jurisdictions where enforcement mechanisms are uncertain, which may result in
prolonged proceedings, substantial litigation costs, diversion of management attention, and
resource allocation away from core operations. Uncertainty in legal enforcement could
hinder our ability to collect receivables, enforce contracts, or protect intellectual property
rights. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial
condition, and results of operations.

The legal systems of the jurisdictions where we operate vary significantly, which may affect
our judgment on legal requirements and our ability to enforce contractual rights.

We operate in countries that follow civil law systems, common law systems, or hybrid
legal systems, where interpretation and application of laws can differ widely. Civil law
systems often give limited precedential value to prior court decisions, while recent laws or
regulations may be subject to reinterpretation. As a result, legal advice and risk assessment
in one jurisdiction may not accurately predict outcomes in another. For example,
enforcement of contractual obligations or intellectual property rights may be delayed,
denied, or require additional compliance procedures. These legal uncertainties could
complicate decision-making, expose us to unforeseen liabilities, or impede the timely
execution of commercial agreements, materially and adversely affecting our operations,
financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

regulatory authorities, our H Shares and A Shares are neither interchangeable nor fungible,
and there is no trading or settlement between the H Share and A Share markets. With
different trading characteristics, the H Share and A Share markets have divergent

[REDACTED] volumes, liquidity and [REDACTED] bases, as well as different levels of
retail and institutional [REDACTED] participation. As a result, the [REDACTED]
performance of our H Shares and A Shares may not be comparable. Nonetheless,
fluctuations in the price of our A Shares may adversely affect the price of our H Shares, and
vice versa. Due to the different characteristics of the H Share and A Share markets, the
historical prices of our A Shares may not be indicative of the performance of our H Shares.
You should therefore not place undue reliance on the trading history of our A Shares when
evaluating the [REDACTED] decision in our H Shares.

There has been no prior [REDACTED] market for our H Shares, an active trading market for
our H Shares may not develop or be sustained

Prior to the [REDACTED], there was no [REDACTED] market for our H Shares. We
cannot assure you that a [REDACTED] market for our H Shares with adequate liquidity
and trading volume will develop and be sustained following the completion of the

[REDACTED]. As the [REDACTED] of our H Shares is higher than the [REDACTED]
consolidated net tangible assets per Share immediately prior to the [REDACTED],
purchasers of our H Shares in the [REDACTED] may experience an immediate dilution. In
addition, the [REDACTED] of our H Shares is expected to be fixed by agreement between
the [REDACTED] (for themselves and on behalf of the [REDACTED] and the

[REDACTED]) and us, and may not be an indication of the market price of our H
Shares at which our H Shares will be traded following the completion of the [REDACTED].
If an active [REDACTED] market for our H Shares does not develop following the
completion of the [REDACTED], the market price and liquidity of our H Shares may be
materially and adversely affected.

RISK FACTORS

The price and trading volume of our H Shares may be volatile, which could result in substantial
losses to you

The price and trading volume of our H Shares may be subject to significant volatility in
response to various factors beyond our control, including the general market conditions of
the securities in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the world. The Stock Exchange and other
securities markets have, from time to time, experienced significant price and trading volume
volatility that are not related to the operating performance of any particular company. The
business and performance and the market price of the shares of other companies engaging
in similar business may also affect the price and trading volume of our H Shares. In
addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume of our H Shares may
be highly volatile for specific business reasons, such as fluctuations in our revenue,
earnings, cash flows, investments, expenditures, regulatory developments, relationships
with our suppliers, movements or activities of key personnel, or actions taken by
competitors. Moreover, shares of other companies [REDACTED] on the Stock Exchange
have experienced price volatility in the past, and it is possible that our H Shares may be
subject to changes in price not directly related to our business performance.

Our historical dividends may not be indicative of our future dividend policy, and there can be
no assurance whether and when we will pay dividends in the future

We have declared dividends in the past. However, there is no assurance that dividends
of any amount will be declared or distributed by us in any year in the future. Under the
applicable laws and regulations of Chinese Mainland, the payment of dividends may be
subject to certain limitations, and the calculation of our profit under the Accounting
Standards for Business Enterprises may differ in certain respects from the calculation under
the IFRSs. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends are subject to the
discretion of our Board of Directors, after taking into account various factors, including
but not limited to our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, capital
expenditure requirements, market conditions, our strategic plans and prospects for business
development, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors as our
Board of Directors may deem relevant, and subject to the approval at Shareholders’
meeting. Any declaration and payment as well as the amount of dividends will be subject to
our constitutional documents and the applicable laws and regulations of Chinese Mainland.
For details, see “Financial Information — Dividends” in this Document. No dividend shall
be declared or payable except out of our profits and reserves lawfully available for
distribution. Our historical dividends should not be taken as indicative of our dividend
policy in the future.

Future sales or perceived sales of our H Shares in the [REDACTED] market could have a
material adverse effect on the [REDACTED] of our H Shares and our ability to raise
additional capital in the future, or may result in dilution of your shareholding

The [REDACTED] of our H Shares and our ability to raise equity capital in the future
at a time and price that we deem appropriate could be negatively impacted as a result of
future sales of our H Shares or other securities relating to our H Shares in the

[REDACTED] by our Shareholders, or the issuance of new shares or other securities, or
the perception that such sales or issuances may occur. In addition, our Shareholders may
experience dilution in their holdings if we issue more securities in the future. Furthermore,
we may issue shares pursuant to any existing or future share option incentive schemes,
which would further dilute our Shareholders’ interests in our Company. New shares or
equity-linked securities issued by us may also confer rights and privileges that take priority

over those conferred by the H Shares. Market sale of Shares by such Shareholders and the
availability of these Shares for future sale may have a negative impact on the market price
of our H Shares.

In addition, while investors subscribing shares in the [REDACTED] are not subject to
any restrictions on the disposal of the H Shares they subscribed, they may have existing
arrangements or agreement to dispose part or all of the H Shares they hold immediately or
within certain period upon completion of the [REDACTED] for legal and regulatory,
business and market, or other reasons. Such disposal may occur within a short period or
any time or period after the [REDACTED]. Any sale of the H Shares subscribed by such
investors pursuant to such arrangement or agreement could adversely affect the market
price of our H Shares and any sizeable sale could have a material and adverse effect on the
market price of our H Shares and could cause substantial volatility in the trading volume of
our H Shares.

You should not place any reliance on any information released by us in connection with the
listing of our A Shares on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange

As our A Shares are listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, we have been subject to
periodic reporting and other information disclosure requirements in Chinese Mainland. As
a result, from time to time, we publicly release information relating to us on the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange or other media outlets designated by the CSRC. However, the information
announced by us in connection with our A Shares listing is based on regulatory
requirements of the securities authorities, industry standards and market practices in
Chinese Mainland, which are different from those applicable to the [REDACTED]. The

decisions as to whether to purchase our H Shares, they should rely only on the financial,
operating and other information included in this document. By applying to purchase our H
Shares in the [REDACTED], you will be deemed to have agreed that you will not rely on

Our operations and transactions involving certain high-risk jurisdictions and entities giving
rise to potential sanctions and/or trade controls concerns expose us to compliance risks that
could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of our
operations.

During the Track Record Period, the Group entered into transactions with the
following counterparties:

. restricted parties subject to targeted sanctions measures and/or restrictions under
certain export control laws (collectively, “Restricted Party Transactions”).


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

RISK FACTORS

On the Restricted Party Transactions, as advised by our International Sanctions and
Trade Controls Legal Advisers, based on the information reviewed, there is no indication
that these transactions constituted any violations or otherwise gave rise to any material
sanctions or export control risks (as the case may be) because: (i) the underlying sanctions
restrictions for certain restricted parties only applied to U.S. persons, for which the relevant
Group entity that engaged in transactions with such restricted parties was not; and (ii) for
restricted parties that were subject to export control restrictions, none of the products
supplied to these counterparties were subject to the Export Administration Regulations
(“EAR”) administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) of the U.S.
Department of Commerce or U.S. export controls.

In addition to the foregoing transactions, the Group had also entered into transactions
during the Track Record Period with customers in jurisdictions generally deemed high-risk
from a sanctions and/or trade controls perspective, such as Russia, Belarus, Ukraine,
Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, as advised by our
International Sanctions and Trade Controls Legal Advisers, these transactions did not
give rise to a material sanctions risk as they did not involve any Sanctioned Targets within
the meaning of Chapter 4.4 or parties otherwise subject to trade related restrictions in those
jurisdictions.

Notwithstanding the above, sanctions laws and export control rules are complex and
subject to change. Future legal and regulatory changes including but not limited to
expanded designations or changes in enforcement priorities could expose the Group to
heightened compliance risks if and to the extent the Group intends to engage in transactions
with any such jurisdictions or entities going forward. Our International Sanctions and
Trade Controls Legal Advisers have advised that we continue to enhance our compliance
measures to enable us to know our customers, so as to mitigate the risks of inadvertently
violating applicable sanctions and export controls.

Any failure to comply with applicable sanctions, export control or other trade-related
regulations could result in regulatory investigations, administrative and/or criminal
penalties, operational and supply chain disruptions, and reputational damage. Our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected as a result.
