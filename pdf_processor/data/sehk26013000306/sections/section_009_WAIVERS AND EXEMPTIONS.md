WAIVERS AND EXEMPTIONS

In preparation for the [REDACTED], we have sought the following waivers and
exemption from strict compliance with the relevant provisions of the Listing Rules and the
Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance:

WAIVER IN RESPECT OF MANAGEMENT PRESENCE IN HONG KONG

Pursuant to Rule 8.12 of the Listing Rules, our Company must have a sufficient
management presence in Hong Kong. This normally means that at least two of our
executive Directors must be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong. Rule 19A.15 of the Listing
Rules further provides that the requirement in Rule 8.12 of the Listing Rules may be waived
by having regard to, among other considerations, our arrangements for maintaining regular
communication with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Our headquarters are based, and most of the business operations of our Group, are
managed and conducted in the PRC. Our executive Directors ordinarily reside in the PRC
and they play very important roles in our Company’s business operations. It is in our best
interests for them to be based in places where our Group has significant operations. We
consider it practically difficult and commercially unreasonable for us to arrange for two
executive Directors to ordinarily reside in Hong Kong, either by means of relocation of our
existing executive Directors or appointment of additional executive Directors. Therefore,
our Company does not have, or does not contemplate in the foreseeable future that we will
have sufficient management presence in Hong Kong for the purpose of satisfying the
requirements under Rule 8.12 of the Listing Rules.

Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 19A.15 of the Listing Rules, we have applied to the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange for, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has granted us, a
waiver from strict compliance with Rule 8.12 of the Listing Rules subject to the following
conditions:

(a) We have appointed Mr. Xiao and Ms. Sham Ying Man (岑影文) (“Ms. Sham”) as
our authorized representatives (the “Authorized Representatives”) pursuant to
Rule 3.05 of the Listing Rules. The Authorized Representatives will act as our
Company’s principal channel of communication with the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange. The Authorized Representatives will be readily contactable by phone,
facsimile and email to promptly deal with inquiries from the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange, and will also be available to meet with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
to discuss any matter within a reasonable period of time upon request of the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange;

(b) When the Hong Kong Stock Exchange wishes to contact our Directors on any
matter, each of the Authorized Representatives will have all necessary means to
contact all of our Directors (including our independent non-executive Directors)
promptly at all times. Our Company will also inform the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange promptly in respect of any changes in the authorized representatives.
We have provided the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with the contact details (i.e.
mobile phone number, office phone number and email address) of all Directors to
facilitate communication with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Our Directors will

WAIVERS AND EXEMPTIONS

also provide the phone number of the place of his/her accommodation to the
Authorized Representatives in the event that any Director expects to travel or
otherwise be out of office;

(c) All Directors who do not ordinarily reside in Hong Kong possess or can apply for
valid travel documents to visit Hong Kong and can meet with the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange within a reasonable period of time;

(d) We have appointed Guotai Junan Capital Limited as our Compliance Advisor
upon the [REDACTED] pursuant to Rule 3A.19 of the Listing Rules for a period
commencing on the [REDACTED] and ending on the date on which we comply
with Rule 13.46 of the Listing Rules in respect of our financial results for the first
full financial year commencing after the [REDACTED]. The Compliance Advisor
will have access at all times to our Authorized Representatives, Directors, who
will act as the additional channel of communication with the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange when the Authorized Representatives are not available. The contact
details of the Compliance Advisor has been provided to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange and the Company will inform the Hong Kong Stock Exchange promptly
in respect of any change in the Compliance Advisor; and

(e) The Company has designated staff members as the communication officer at the
Company’s headquarters after the [REDACTED] who will be responsible for
maintaining day-to-day communication with the Authorized Representatives, and
the Company’s professional advisors in Hong Kong, including our legal advisors
in Hong Kong and the Compliance Advisor, to keep abreast of any
correspondences and/or inquiries from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and
report to the executive Directors to further facilitate communication between the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Company.

WAIVER IN RESPECT OF APPOINTMENT OF JOINT COMPANY SECRETARY

Pursuant to Rules 3.28 and 8.17 of the Listing Rules, we must appoint a company
secretary who, by virtue of his/her academic or professional qualifications or relevant
experience, is, in the opinion of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, capable of discharging the
functions of the company secretary. Note 1 to Rule 3.28 of the Listing Rules provides that
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange considers the following academic or professional
qualifications to be acceptable:

(a) a member of The Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute;

(b) a solicitor or barrister as defined in the Legal Practitioners Ordinance (Chapter
159 of the Laws of Hong Kong); and

(c) a certified public accountant as defined in the Professional Accountants
Ordinance (Chapter 50 of the Laws of Hong Kong).

WAIVERS AND EXEMPTIONS

Note 2 to Rule 3.28 of the Listing Rules further provides that the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange considers the following factors in assessing the “relevant experience” of the
individual:

(a) length of employment with the issuer and other issuers and the roles he/she
played;

(b) familiarity with the Listing Rules and other relevant laws and regulations
including the SFO, the Companies Ordinance, the Companies (Winding Up and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance and the Takeovers Code;

(c) relevant training taken and/or to be taken in addition to the minimum
requirement under Rule 3.29 of the Listing Rules; and

(d) professional qualifications in other jurisdictions.

Our Company has appointed Mr. Liang as one of our joint company secretaries. Mr.
Liang has sufficient experience in legal and capital markets affairs but presently does not
possess any of the qualifications under Rules 3.28 and 8.17 of the Listing Rules, and may
not be able to solely fulfill the requirements of the Listing Rules. Therefore, we have
appointed Ms. Sham, who is a member of The Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute,
who fully meets the requirements stipulated under Rules 3.28 and 8.17 of the Listing Rules
to act as the other joint company secretary. Ms. Sham will provide assistance to Mr. Liang
for an initial period of three years from the [REDACTED] to enable Mr. Liang to acquire
the “relevant experience” under Note 2 to Rule 3.28 of the Listing Rules so as to fully
comply with the requirements set forth under Rules 3.28 and 8.17 of the Listing Rules.

Since Mr. Liang does not possess the formal qualifications required of a company
secretary under Rule 3.28 of the Listing Rules, we have applied to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange for, a waiver from strict compliance with the requirements under Rules 3.28 and
8.17 of the Listing Rules such that Mr. Liang may be appointed as a joint company
secretary of our Company. Pursuant to paragraph 13 of Chapter 3.10 under the Guide for
New Listing Applicants published by the Stock Exchange, the waiver will be for a fixed
period of time (the “Waiver Period”) and on the following conditions: (i) the proposed
company secretary must be assisted by a person who possesses the qualifications or
experience as required under Rule 3.28 of the Listing Rules and is appointed as a joint
company secretary throughout the Waiver Period; and (ii) the waiver can be revoked if
there are material breaches of the Listing Rules by the issuer. The waiver is valid for an
initial period of three years from the [REDACTED], and is granted on the condition that
Ms. Sham will work closely with Mr. Liang to jointly discharge the duties and
responsibilities as company secretary and assist Mr. Liang in acquiring the relevant
experience as required under Rules 3.28 and 8.17 of the Listing Rules. Ms. Sham will also
assist Mr. Liang in organizing Board meetings and Shareholders’ meetings of our Company
as well as other matters of our Company which are incidental to the duties of a company
secretary. Ms. Sham is expected to work closely with Mr. Liang and will maintain regular
contact with Mr. Liang, the Directors and the senior management of our Company. The
waiver will be revoked immediately if Ms. Sham ceases to provide assistance to Mr. Liang
as a joint company secretary for the three-year period after the [REDACTED] or where

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

WAIVERS AND EXEMPTIONS

there are material breaches of the Listing Rules by our Company. In addition, Mr. Liang
will comply with the annual professional training requirement under Rule 3.29 of the
Listing Rules and will enhance his knowledge of the Listing Rules during the three-year
period from the [REDACTED]. Mr. Liang will also be assisted by (a) Compliance Advisor
of our Company, particularly in relation to compliance with the Listing Rules; and (b) the
Hong Kong legal advisors of our Company, on matters concerning our Company’s ongoing
compliance with the Listing Rules and the applicable laws and regulations.

Before the expiration of the initial three-year period, the qualifications of Mr. Liang
will be re-evaluated to determine whether the requirements as stipulated in Rules 3.28 and
8.17 of the Listing Rules can be satisfied. We will liaise with the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange to enable it to assess whether Mr. Liang, having benefited from the assistance of
Ms. Sham for the preceding three years, will have acquired the skills necessary to carry out
the duties of company secretary and the relevant experience within the meaning of Note 2 to
Rule 3.28 of the Listing Rules so that a further waiver will not be necessary.

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IN RESPECT OF OUTSTANDING SHARE
INCENTIVES

The Listing Rules and the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions)
Ordinance prescribe certain disclosure requirements in relation to the Share Incentives
granted by our Company (the “Share Incentive Disclosure Requirements”):

(a) Rule 17.02(1)(b) of the Listing Rules stipulates that all material terms of a share
scheme must be clearly set out in this Document. Our Company is also required to
disclose in this Document full details of all outstanding Share Incentives and their
potential dilution effect on the shareholdings upon the [REDACTED] as well as
the impact on the earnings per share arising from the issue of shares in respect of
such outstanding Share Incentives;

(b) paragraph 27 of Appendix D1A to the Listing Rules requires our Company to set
out in this Document particulars of any capital of any member of our Group that
is under option, or agreed conditionally or unconditionally to be put under
option, including the consideration for which the option was or will be granted
and the price and duration of the option, and the name and address of the grantee;
and

(c) paragraph 10 of the Third Schedule to the Companies (Winding Up and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance requires that our Company shall disclose
in this Document the number, description and amount of any shares in or
debentures of our Company which any person has or is entitled to be given, an
option to subscribe for, together with the following particulars of the option, that
is to say, (a) the period during which it is exercisable; (b) the price to be paid for
shares or debentures subscribed for under it; (c) the consideration (if any) given or
to be given for it or for the right to it; (d) the names and addresses of the persons
to whom it or the right to it was given or, if given to existing shareholders or
debenture holders as such, the relevant shares or debentures.

WAIVERS AND EXEMPTIONS

Pursuant to paragraphs 6 to 7 of Chapter 3.6 of the Listing Guide, the Stock Exchange
would normally grant waivers from disclosing the names and addresses of certain grantees if
the issuer could demonstrate that such disclosures would be irrelevant and unduly
burdensome, subject to certain conditions specified therein.

As of the Latest Practicable Date, each of the 2022 Option and Restricted Share
Incentive Plan, 2023 Option and Restricted Share Incentive Plan and 2024 Option and
Restricted Share Incentive Plan was in effect, to which the Share Incentive Disclosure
Requirements are applicable. For details, see “IV 4. OPTION AND RESTRICTED
SHARE INCENTIVE PLANS” to this Document.

As of the Latest Practicable Date, the total number of A Shares underlying all
outstanding Share Incentives under the Share Incentive Plans amounted to 2,380,800,
accounting for approximately [REDACTED] of the total issued Shares upon completion of
the [REDACTED] (assuming (i) [REDACTED] is not exercised and (ii) no other changes
are made to the issued share capital of our Company between the Latest Practicable Date
and the [REDACTED]), of which the outstanding Share Incentives representing [2,147,200]
A Shares were granted to our Directors, senior management and also our employees,
respectively, accounting for approximately [REDACTED] of the total number of Shares in
issue immediately after completion of the [REDACTED] (assuming (i) the [REDACTED] is
not exercised, and (ii) no other changes are made to the issued share capital of our
Company between the Latest Practicable Date and the [REDACTED]).

We have applied to: (i) the Stock Exchange for a waiver from strict compliance with
the disclosure requirements under Rule 17.02(1)(b) of, and paragraph 27 of Appendix D1A
to, the Listing Rules; and (ii) the SFC for a certificate of exemption under section 342A of
the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, exempting our
Company from strict compliance with paragraph 10(d) of the Third Schedule to the
Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, respectively, on the
grounds that strict compliance with the Share Incentive Disclosure Requirements would be
unduly burdensome for our Company and the waiver and exemption would not prejudice
the interest of the [REDACTED], taking into account the following reasons:

(a) given that over [300] grantees (other than our Directors and senior management)
are involved under the Share Incentive Plans, strict compliance with such
disclosure requirements in setting out full details of all the grantees under the
Share Incentive Plans in this Document would be costly and unduly burdensome
for our Company in light of a significant increase in cost and time for information
compilation and document preparation. For example, the disclosure of personal
information of each grantee may require the consent of all grantees to comply
with personal information privacy laws and principles. Given the number of
grantees, obtaining their consent would cause an unnecessary burden on our
Company;

(b) full disclosure of the Share Incentives granted to each grantee could provide our
employees with access to information about the remuneration of their peers or
other employees, which may have a negative impact on employee morale, lead to

WAIVERS AND EXEMPTIONS

negative internal competition and result in increased costs of recruiting and
retaining talents. On the contrary, not disclosing such details in full will allow us
more flexibility in determining our remuneration policies and details;

(c) full disclosure of the details of the grantees and the respective Share Incentives
granted to them will provide competitors with details of our employee
remuneration and facilitate their recruitment activities, which may affect our
Group’s ability to recruit and retain valuable personnel;

(d) the grant and exercise in full of the Share Incentives under the Share Incentive
Plans will not cause any material adverse impact to the financial position of our
Group;

(e) there will not be any new H Shares issued under the Share Incentive Plans as such
plans are A-Share incentive plans;

(f) not fully compliant with the Share Incentive Disclosure Requirements would not
prevent our Company from providing our [REDACTED] with an informed
assessment of the activities, assets, liabilities, financial position, management and
prospects of our Company; and

(g) material information relating to the Share Incentives has been disclosed in this
Document to provide [REDACTED] with sufficient information to make an
informed decisions.

Therefore, we have applied for, a waiver from strict compliance with Rule 17.02(1)(b)
of, and paragraph 27 of Appendix D1A to, the Listing Rules in relation to the Share
Incentive Plans on the conditions that:

(a) a summary of the latest terms of the Share Incentive Plans is disclosed in
“Appendix VI — Statutory and General Information — 4. Share Incentive Plans”

Incentives granted by our Company to our Directors and senior management, on
an individual basis, are disclosed in “Appendix VI — Statutory and General
Information — 4. Share Incentive Plans” to this Document. With respect to the
Share Incentives granted to the Other Connected Persons, the following details
are disclosed on an aggregated basis in this Document: (i) the number of grantees,
the type of Share Incentives and the number of Shares underlying the Share
Incentives, (ii) the consideration paid for the grant of the Share Incentives, and
(iii) the vesting/exercise period and the exercise price of the Share Incentives;
