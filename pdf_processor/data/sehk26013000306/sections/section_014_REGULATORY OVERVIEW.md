LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS IN THE UNITED
STATES

Businesses operating in the United States are subject to a variety of federal, state and
local laws and regulations (“U.S. Regulations”). The U.S. Regulations expected to be
material to our operations are those relating to, among others, product safety, product
liability, data privacy and customs and imports procedures as described below.

Product Safety

The law of product safety is primarily under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”), an administrative agency of the United States
federal government that regulates certain classes of products sold to the public. The CPSC
was established pursuant to the 1972 Consumer Product Safety Act (as amended, the
“CPSA”). The CPSA is the umbrella statute at the federal level with respect to product
safety for consumer products.

The CPSA was amended by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of
2008 (“CPSIA”) in 2008. The implementation of CPSIA was a significant overhaul of
consumer product safety laws in the United States and was designed to enhance federal and
state efforts to improve the safety of all products imported into and distributed in the
United States. Products imported into the United States which fail to comply with CPSIA’s
requirements are subject to confiscation and the importer and/or distributor in the United
States is subject to civil penalties and fines, as well as possible criminal prosecution.

Under the CPSIA, a “general conformity certification” is required for any consumer
product imported into the United States that is subject to a consumer product safety rule,
standard, regulation, or ban pursuant to the CPSA or issued by the CPSC. The requirement
applies to all subcontractors and importers of goods. Those parties must certify that their
products comply with all applicable consumer product safety rules and laws such as the
CPSA, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Federal Hazardous Substance Act, and the Poison
Prevention Act. The CPSA specifies that certification must be based on a “test of each
product or a reasonable testing program.” The certificate must accompany the product or
shipment of products, and a copy must be furnished to each distributor or retailer and U.S.
Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”). The CPSC may also request a copy of the
certification.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

REGULATORY OVERVIEW

The CPSA also contains several reporting requirements for subcontractors and sellers
of consumer products sold in the U.S. Section 15 of the CPSA requires a manufacturer or a
seller to inform the CPSC immediately in the event it obtains information that any of its
products: (1) creates a substantial risk of injury to consumers; (2) creates an unreasonable
risk of serious injury or death; or (3) fails to comply with an applicable consumer product
safety rule or with any other rule, regulation, standard, or ban under the CPSA or any other
statute enforced by the CPSC. The CPSC may require the manufacturer or the seller to
cease distribution of the product, and notify each person to whom the manufacturer or the
seller knows such product was sold of such noncompliance, defects or risk. In certain
circumstances, the CPSC may require the manufacturer or the seller to bring the product
into conformity with the applicable product safety rules, repair the defect in the product,
replace the product with an equivalent product that complies with the applicable product
safety rules, issue a product recall and/or refund the purchase price of the product.

Proposition 65

Proposition 65, officially known as the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement
Act of 1986 (“Prop 65”), is a California law that requires that California consumers receive
warnings regarding the presence of more than 800 chemicals known to cause cancer and/or
reproductive toxicity. The law is highly technical, constantly evolving, and actively enforced
by the government and private enforcement action. Under Prop 65, any person in the course
of doing business must provide a “clear and reasonable warning” before exposing
individuals to listed carcinogens and reproductive toxins in their products. Prop 65
provides detailed requirements for the form, content, and placement of the required
warning.

The probability that a company will be subject to Prop 65 regulations is high because
of how broadly the statute is worded. If a company manufactures, imports, distributes or
sells a product that will be sold in California either through brick and mortar or online
stores, or if a company has a physical presence of any kind in California (retail, office,
warehouse, facility, factory, plant, etc.), then that company must abide by Prop 65
requirements. Recently, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
(OEHHA) adopted a significant amendment to the Prop 65 warning requirement allowing
companies to provide notice of the potentially toxic product either to the authorized agent
for the business to whom they are selling or transferring the product, i.e., the next business
in line, or to the authorized agent for the retail seller. Although this amendment appears to
minimize the burden on companies, paying careful attention to Prop 65 requirements is
encouraged. Auditing Prop 65 compliance well in advance could mean avoiding costly
lawsuits, the loss of valuable business opportunities or relationships, large monetary
penalties, serious financial or reputational damage, or even product recalls.

Product Liability Law

U.S. state law generally imposes liability on all subcontractors and retailers (and
parties in the supply chain) for injuries that result from unsafe, defective and dangerous
products sold to consumers. Product liability claims in the United States are typically based
on three theories of law: (1) strict liability, (2) negligence and (3) breach of warranty. In


-----

REGULATORY OVERVIEW

addition, as noted above, U.S. laws and regulations can also obligate subcontractors and
retailers (and parties in the supply chain) to remedy product defects, which can include
safety recall campaigns.

Parties involved in manufacturing, distributing or selling a product may be subject to
liability for harm caused by a defect in that product. There are three types of product
defects, namely, design defects, manufacturing defects and defects in marketing. In a
negligence claim, a defendant may be held liable for personal injury or property damage
caused by the failure to use due care. Strict liability claims, however, do not depend on the
defendant’s level of care. Instead, a defendant is liable when it is shown that an injury
(personal or to property) occurred as the result of a product’s defect. Breach of warranty is
also a form of strict liability in the sense that a showing of fault is not required. The
plaintiff need only establish the warranty was breached, regardless of how that came about.
Companies that manufacture, distribute or sell a product in a particular state may be
subject to the jurisdiction of such state’s product liability laws, whether the company’s
jurisdiction of incorporation or principal place of business is in that state, in another U.S.
state or in a non-U.S. jurisdiction.

Product liability legal actions and recall campaigns in the United States could involve
personal injury and property damage and could involve claims for substantial monetary
damages. The results of any future litigation and claims involving product liability in the
United States are inherently unpredictable. Based on our past experience, we do not
anticipate that, in the aggregate, the outcome of any such litigation and claims involving us
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such
outcome could be material to our results of operations in particular period in which costs, if
any are recognized by us.

Data Privacy

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States that involve
privacy, data protection and personal information, data security, and data retention and
deletion. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy
and protection of people’s data. U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, which in some
cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly
evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application,
interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain,
particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be
interpreted and applied inconsistently from state to state and country to country and
inconsistently with our current policies and practices.

Import Tariffs and Customs Regulations

United States customs regulations (“Customs Regulations”), administered by CBP
apply to any products entering the United States. Those regulations cover, among other
areas, valuation of goods, classification, recordkeeping requirements, entry formalities, and
laws related to duties and tariffs. The United States imposes tariffs on certain goods
imported from various countries. Tariff rates are generally set forth in the Harmonized
Tariff Schedules of the United States (the “HTSUS”). Note that embargoes, antidumping


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

REGULATORY OVERVIEW

duties, countervailing duties, and other specific matters administered by the United States
executive branch are not contained in the HTSUS and that various regulations or
administrative actions could result in modification of these duties. Section 201 of the Trade
Act of 1974, 19 USC §2101 et. seq. (the “Trade Act”) permits the President of the United
States to grant temporary import relief by raising import duties or imposing non-tariff
barriers (e.g., quotas) on goods entering the United States that injure or threaten to injure
domestic industries producing similar goods. Section 301 of the Trade Act authorizes the
President of the United States to take all appropriate action, including retaliation, to obtain
the removal of any act, policy, or practice of a foreign government that violates an
international trade agreement or is unjustified, unreasonable, or discriminatory, and that
burdens or restricts U.S. commerce. The law does not require that the U.S. government wait
until it receives authorization from the World Trade Organization to take such enforcement
actions.

Currently, U.S. and China trade policy has given rise to the imposition of significant
additional tariffs on products imported in the United States from China, and vice versa,
under Section 301 of the Trade Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

Depending on the latest development of the trade negotiations between the U.S. and
China, the level and number of products subject to additional tariffs may change over time.

Corporate Income Tax

U.S. corporate income tax is imposed at the federal level on all entities treated as
corporations and by 47 states and the District of Columbia. The U.S. corporate income tax
(CIT) rate is based on a progressive rate schedule; however, an alternative minimum tax
provides for a flat rate with fewer deductions. Certain localities also impose corporate
income tax. Corporate income tax is imposed on all domestic corporations and on foreign
corporations having income or activities within the jurisdiction.

Transfer Pricing

The U.S. has an extensive system of laws and practices designed to preserve the U.S.
tax base by preventing income from being shifted among related parties through the
inappropriate pricing of related party transactions. The U.S. transfer pricing regime seeks
to ensure that transactions involving the transfer goods and services between related
companies are made on an arm’s length basis and are priced based on market conditions
that permit profit to be reflected in the appropriate tax jurisdiction. Where the results of a
transaction do not reflect an arm’s length price, the U.S. tax authority can reallocate the
income to reflect the appropriate price and in some cases, impose monetary penalties for
substantial or deliberate inaccuracy.

The U.S. Congress has enacted legislation and the US Treasury Department has
promulgated regulations to control transfer pricing, all of which are administered and
enforced by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act (Tax Act) became law. The Tax Act represents a comprehensive reform to the
Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). Among its many changes, the Tax Act lowered the federal
corporate income tax rate to 21% and overhauled the international tax provisions of the

REGULATORY OVERVIEW

IRC, which may cause many multi-national companies to reevaluate their transfer pricing
arrangements. Additionally, the Tax Act amended the IRC’s transfer pricing provisions,
which will directly affect transfers of intangible property.

Federal tax legislation is contained in the IRC. Specifically, Section 482 of the IRC
governs transfer pricing and applies when two or more organizations, trades, or businesses
(regardless of form and place of the organization) are owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by the same interests. The general rule of Section 482 authorizes the IRS to
reallocate income, deductions, credits or allowances among the members of a controlled
group of entities to ensure clear reflection of income or to prevent tax avoidance.

Section 482 also provides an additional test for transfers of intangible property (IP).
Income with respect to the transfer (or license) of IP must be “commensurate with the
income” attributable to the IP. Under the commensurate-with-income standard, actual
profit realized from the exploitation of an intangible must be considered in determining an
arm’s length price for the transfer of the intangible. The amount of the compensation
should therefore reflect changes in the income attributable to that intangible over time.

In the U.S., individual states enact their own corporate income tax rules, which include
the power and authority to regulate transfer pricing. The state rules focus on the shifting of
income and deductions from a high-tax state to lower-tax states. Although the focus of most
multinational businesses is on the relationship with the IRS, the state-by-state approach to
transfer pricing methodologies must not be ignored. Each state is a sovereign taxing
jurisdiction with the authority to disregard the conclusions reached by the IRS with respect
to the appropriateness of a particular transfer pricing method.

Each of the 50 U.S. states has its own internal statutes, regulations, case law and other
authority governing transfer pricing issues.

Contract Law

Contract law in the U.S. governs the obligations established by agreements between
private parties. Whether these agreements are express or implied, they create legally
enforceable rights and duties. The law of contracts varies from state to state. Each state has
its own set of rules and principles governing contracts. However, there are certain areas
where federal contract law applies nationwide.

Misrepresentation under U.S. contract law generally occurs when one party makes a
false statement of law or fact to another party which induces that other party to enter into a
contract. More specifically, fraudulent misrepresentation under U.S. contract law occurs
when one party makes an intentional or reckless misrepresentation of fact or opinion with
the intention to coerce another party into action or inaction on the basis of that
misrepresentation. Courts may award damages to the injured party, typically monetary
compensation, and punitive damages are generally not awarded.

REGULATORY OVERVIEW

Fraud under civil tort or criminal law might be based on a misrepresentation of fact
that was either intentional or negligent. Under federal law, criminal fraud includes any
scheme to defraud, or using false promises or representation to obtain one’s money or
property. And the definition is similar in most state laws across the U.S. Penalties for
criminal fraud generally include life imprisonment, fines, and/or restitution to pay back.

U.S. Economic Sanctions

U.S. economic sanctions rules generally impose various restrictions on transactions or
economic activities involving certain countries, specific sectors, as well as certain designated
parties or entities, depending on the type of sanctions program that is involved. U.S.
sanctions laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and are subject to change
with little to no warning in response to evolving geopolitical and national security interests.
The principal agency that is responsible for administering and enforcing U.S. sanctions is
the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury,
although there are some aspects of certain U.S. sanctions programs that are also
administered by the U.S. Department of State.

U.S. sanctions can be classified into “primary sanctions” or “secondary sanctions”. In
general, primary sanctions are economic restrictions that broadly comprise of: (a)
comprehensive sanctions; and (b) targeted sanctions such as list-based sanctions and
sectoral sanctions. U.S. primary sanctions apply to all U.S. persons, which includes: (1) all
entities organized under the laws of the U.S. or any jurisdiction within the U.S. (including
foreign branches); (2) all U.S. citizens and permanent residents (wherever located); and (3)
all persons physically located in the U.S., regardless of nationality. For certain sanctions
programs pertaining to Iran and Cuba, the definition of “U.S. persons” may also include
foreign companies owned or controlled by U.S. persons. Comprehensive sanctions prohibit
virtually all U.S. persons from engaging in transactions and dealings with an entire country
or region. OFAC currently maintains comprehensive sanctions against North Korea, Cuba,
Iran, the Crimea region of Ukraine, as well as the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s
Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic. List-based sanctions on the other hand generally
prohibit all activities and dealings with targeted individuals and entities that have been
found to have engaged in conduct or activities that are contrary to the foreign policy and
national security interests of the United States, such as those individuals and entities listed
on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List). Finally,
sectoral sanctions are restrictions targeted at specific strategic industries rather than an
entire country. OFAC currently maintains sectoral sanctions against the financial, energy,
and defense sectors of the Russian economy for example.

On the other hand, secondary sanctions are intended to assert additional pressure on
sanctions imposed on a particular target by penalizing non-U.S. persons for directly or
indirectly providing material assistance to, or otherwise engaging in or facilitating
significant transactions with, sanctioned targets, even in the absence of a U.S. nexus.
U.S. secondary sanctions are extraterritorial in nature and are aimed at deterring non-U.S.
persons from engaging in economic activities with sanctioned targets by threatening to
restrict their access to the U.S. market.

U.S. Export Controls

The United States export controls framework is designed to regulate the transfer of
controlled items, sensitive goods, materials, software, technologies, and services to foreign
countries and parties outside of the U.S. to protect its foreign policy and national security
interests. The main administrative agency responsible for enforcing U.S. export controls is
the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, which
administers the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), the primary legal framework
governing these controls. Apart from the BIS, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls
(DDTC) of the U.S. Department of State regulates and enforces U.S. export controls under
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) that relate to defense-related articles
and services.

Under the EAR, a license, license exception or authorization from BIS may be required
for the export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) of items subject to the EAR, depending
on the item’s classification, destination, end-user and end-use. Generally speaking, items
‘subject to the EAR’ include: (a) all items in the U.S., including in a U.S. Foreign Trade
Zone or moving in-transit through the U.S. from one foreign country to another (with
certain exceptions); (b) U.S.-origin items, wherever located; and (c) certain foreign-made
items that incorporate more than a de minimis amount of U.S.-origin controlled content as
defined in the EAR or that are produced abroad using U.S. software, technology, or tools.
The EAR also contains various lists that identify certain foreign parties who are subject to
stringent export controls restrictions in relation to items subject to the EAR. The Entity
List for example identifies persons reasonably believed to be involved, or pose a significant
risk of being or becoming involved, in activities contrary to the national security or foreign
policy interests of the U.S. The EAR imposes license requirements on, and limits the
availability of most license exceptions in relation to, the supply of items subject to the EAR
to persons on the Entity List. The Military End-User List on the other hand identifies
foreign parties as military end users that are subject to a license requirement for the export,
reexport, or transfer (in-country) of certain items specified in the EAR.

RELEVANT LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF THE THAILAND (“THAI”)

This section summarizes the major Thai laws, regulations and policies relevant to the
Company’s daily business operations currently carried out in Thai.

1. Corporate Matters

The Thai Subsidiary is incorporated as a private limited company under the Civil and
Commercial Code of Thailand (the “CCC”). A Thai private limited company is a separate
juristic person and must have at least two shareholders at all times. Shareholders’ liability is
generally limited to the unpaid amount on their respective shares.

A private limited company is managed by a board of directors appointed by the
shareholders. There is no statutory requirement regarding the minimum number or
nationality of directors. Directors are authorised to manage the business of the company in
accordance with the company’s objectives, Articles of Association, shareholders’
resolutions and applicable Thai laws, and may delegate certain powers to officers or
managers.

The registered capital of a Thai private limited company is divided into shares of equal
par value. At least 25% of the par value of each issued share must be paid up upon issuance.
Share transfers must be made in writing and signed by the transferor and transferee in the
presence of at least one witness, and are not effective against the company or third parties
unless recorded in the company’s register of shareholders.

Dividends may be distributed only out of profits and generally require shareholders’
approval, except that interim dividends may be declared by the directors if permitted under
the articles of association. The CCC requires an appropriation of at least 5% of net profits
as a reserve until such reserve reaches 10% of the registered capital.

REGULATORY OVERVIEW

2. Restrictions on Foreign Ownership

Foreign ownership and investment in Thailand are principally governed by the Foreign
Business Act B.E. 2542 (1999) (the “FBA”). A company is classified as a “foreign” entity if
50% or more of its shares are held by non-Thai individuals or juristic persons.

The FBA categorises restricted business activities into three lists. List 1 comprises
businesses strictly prohibited to foreigners. List 2 covers businesses related to national
security, culture and natural resources, which may be carried on by foreigners only with
Cabinet approval. List 3 covers trading, service businesses and other activities in which
Thai nationals are not yet considered ready to compete with foreigners, and which may be
carried on by foreigners subject to a foreign business licence issued by the Department of
Business Development.

Manufacturing activities are generally not restricted under the FBA. Based on the
nature of its manufacturing business, the Thai Subsidiary is not required to obtain a foreign
business licence under the FBA for its current operations.

3. Board of Investment of Thailand (BOI)

The Investment Promotion Act B.E. 2520 (1977) establishes the Board of Investment of
Thailand (the “BOI”) to promote domestic and foreign investment in activities considered
beneficial to Thailand’s economic and industrial development.

The BOI grants investment promotion privileges in respect of eligible activities, subject
to compliance with specified conditions. Such privileges may include tax incentives, such as
exemptions of corporate income tax, import duty and withholding on dividends and
non-tax incentives, such as permission for foreign-owned companies to own land for
promoted activities, visa and work permit privileges and to engage in certain activities
otherwise restricted under the FBA.

The Thai Subsidiary is a BOI-promoted company and has been granted certain tax and
non-tax incentives in respect of its promoted manufacturing activities under 3 BOI
promotion certificates, subject to the terms, conditions and duration set out in the relevant
BOI promotion certificates and applicable laws. Based on the information and documents
provided to us, we are not aware of any non-compliance with such BOI promotion
certificates or any changes in applicable Thai laws which would materially and adversely
affect the incentives granted to the Thai Subsidiary by the BOI.

4. Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT)

The Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (the “IEAT”) is a state enterprise under
the Ministry of Industry responsible for the establishment, development and regulation of
industrial estates in Thailand.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

REGULATORY OVERVIEW

Operators located within IEAT-administered industrial estates benefit from centralised
infrastructure, utilities, waste management systems and regulatory oversight. In addition to
general Thai laws, such operators are subject to regulations issued by the IEAT governing
operational standards, environmental management and safety.

The Thai Subsidiary operates its manufacturing facilities (Factory phase 2) within an
Pinthong industrial estate (Project 3) and has obtained the relevant permissions to operate
therein.

5. Factory Permits

The establishment and operation of factories in Thailand are governed principally by
the Factory Act B.E. 2535 (1992), as amended (the “Factory Act”). Under the Factory Act,
a factory operator whose activities fall within the statutory thresholds relating to the use of
machinery, number of workers and nature of production is generally required to obtain a
factory permit (Ror. Ngor. 4) from the competent authority prior to commencing
operations. The Factory Act also imposes ongoing obligations on factory operators in
relation to, among others, the installation and operation of machinery, workplace safety
and accident prevention measures, environmental pollution control, industrial waste
management, and reporting and inspection requirements, and any material change to the
factory or manufacturing process may require prior approval from the relevant authority.

Where a factory is located within an industrial estate established and supervised by the
IEAT, the licensing and regulatory authority in respect of factory operations rests with the
IEAT. In such case, the factory operator is not required to obtain a factory permit under
the Factory Act from the Department of Industrial Works, but must instead obtain
approval from and comply with the rules, regulations and conditions prescribed by the
IEAT, which incorporate factory safety, environmental and operational standards
comparable to those under the Factory Act.

The Thai Subsidiary holds valid factory permit issued under the Factory Act for its
manufacturing facilities located outside the IEAT zone (Factory Phases 1 and 3), and, based
on the information and documents provided to us, is in compliance in all material respects
with the applicable licensing requirements.

6. Land Ownership

Under Thai law, foreigners are generally restricted from owning land in Thailand
unless permitted under specific legislation. Pursuant to applicable Thai laws, an industrial
operator located within an industrial estate established and supervised by the IEAT, or a
company granted investment promotion by the BOI, may be permitted to own land for the
purpose of carrying on its business, notwithstanding the general restrictions on foreign land
ownership, subject to the terms and conditions prescribed by the IEAT or the BOI, as
applicable.

The Thai Subsidiary owns the land on which its manufacturing facilities located within
the IEAT zone are situated, pursuant to the land ownership permission granted by the
IEAT. Such land is used for the operation of the Thai Subsidiary’s business and, based on


-----

REGULATORY OVERVIEW

the information and documents provided to us, the Thai Subsidiary has complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements relating to such land ownership. As of
the date of this document, we are not aware of any existing or proposed changes in
applicable Thai laws or regulations that would materially and adversely affect such land
ownership rights.

7. Environmental Laws

Environmental matters in Thailand are principally governed by the Enhancement and
Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act B.E. 2535 (1992), as amended,
together with regulations and notifications issued thereunder and other sector-specific laws,
including the Factory Act and the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand Act. These laws
regulate, among others, the prevention and control of environmental pollution arising from
industrial operations, including wastewater discharge, air emissions, noise, vibration and
industrial waste management, and empower the relevant authorities to prescribe
environmental standards and conduct inspections.

For factories located within an industrial estate under the supervision of the IEAT, the
IEAT acts as the primary regulatory authority responsible for environmental supervision
and monitoring. Operators are required to install and maintain appropriate systems for the
treatment of wastewater, control of air emissions and proper disposal of industrial waste,
and to comply with environmental standards and reporting requirements prescribed by the
IEAT and the relevant governmental authorities. For factories located outside the IEAT
zone, environmental regulation and supervision are primarily governed by the Factory Act,
and related regulations administered by the Department of Industrial Works, including
requirements on pollution control, waste management and environmental reporting. Based
on the information and documents provided to us, the Thai Subsidiary has implemented the
required environmental control measures for its manufacturing operations and is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations.

8. Trade Restrictions

The import and export of goods in Thailand are regulated principally by the Customs
Act B.E. 2560 (2017), together with ministerial regulations and notifications issued by the
Thai Customs Department and other relevant authorities. Under Thai law, goods imported
into or exported from Thailand are subject to customs clearance procedures, declaration
requirements and payment of applicable customs duties, unless an exemption applies under
applicable laws or privileges granted by competent authorities.

As a manufacturing company engaged in the import of raw materials and machinery
and the export of its products, the Thai Subsidiary is required to comply with applicable
customs procedures, including accurate declaration of goods, customs valuation, tariff
classification and compliance with export control requirements. Certain products may also
be subject to specific import or export restrictions, licensing requirements or standards
controls imposed under sector-specific laws. For the Thai Subsidiary, exemptions from
import duties on machinery and raw materials are granted by the BOI. Based on the
information and documents provided to us, and having regard to the nature of the raw
materials imported and the products exported by the Thai Subsidiary, we are not aware of


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

REGULATORY OVERVIEW

any material trade restrictions, prohibitions or licensing requirements applicable to such
imports or exports under Thai law. The Thai Subsidiary conducts its import and export
activities in compliance in all material respects with applicable Thai customs and
trade-related laws and regulations.

9. Intellectual Property

Intellectual property rights in Thailand are principally governed by the Trademark Act
B.E. 2534 (1991), the Patent Act B.E. 2522 (1979) and the Copyright Act B.E. 2537 (1994),
as amended. These laws provide statutory protection for registered intellectual property
rights and grant the right holders the exclusive right to use and enforce such rights against
infringement in Thailand.

Based on the information and documents provided to us, the Thai Subsidiary does not
own or have any registered intellectual property rights in Thailand. However, the Company
has registered certain trademark in Thailand, which are used in connection with the
Group’s business. Under Thai law, trademark rights arise upon registration, and registered
trademarks may be licensed to affiliates for use in Thailand, subject to compliance with
applicable legal requirements.

10. Taxation

Thai companies are subject to corporate income tax on their worldwide income at the
prevailing rate (currently 20%), subject to applicable exemptions and incentives. As an
investment-promoted company, the Thai Subsidiary has been granted an exemption from
corporate income tax for a period of three years in respect of profits generated from its
BOI-promoted activities, subject to the terms and conditions prescribed by the relevant BOI
promotion certificates and applicable laws.

Withholding tax applies to certain categories of income, including dividends, interest,
royalties and service fees, at rates prescribed by the Revenue Code.

Thailand operates a Value Added Tax (“VAT”) system. VAT in Thailand is imposed
on the sale of goods, the provision of services and the importation of goods. Under the VAT
system, an operator charges VAT on its sales or services and may credit VAT paid on
purchases of goods or services against its output VAT, with the net amount remitted to the
Thai Revenue Department, such that VAT is effectively borne by the end consumer. The
standard VAT rate prescribed by law is 10% (inclusive of municipal tax). However, the rate
currently applied is 7%, subject to extension by the Thai government from time to time. As
a manufacturing company, the Thai Subsidiary is subject to VAT in respect of its sale of
goods and importation of goods and is required to comply with applicable VAT
registration, filing and payment obligations under Thai tax laws.

THE HONG KONG LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES

This section summarizes the major Hong Kong laws, regulations and policies relevant
to the Company’s daily business operations currently carried out through its subsidiary in
Hong Kong.

LAWS RELATING TO BUSINESS REGISTRATION

Business Registration Ordinance (Chapter 310 of the Laws of Hong Kong) (the “BRO”)

According to the BRO, every person, (a company or individual), who carries on a
business in Hong Kong is required under the BRO to apply for a business registration
certificate from the Inland Revenue Department within one month from the date of
commencement of the business, and to display a valid business registration certificate at the
place of business. Business registration does not serve to regulate business activities and it is
not a licence to trade. Business registration serves to notify the Inland Revenue Department
of the establishment of a business in Hong Kong. A business registration certificate is
renewable every year or every three years (if business operators elect for issuance of
business registration certificate that is valid for three years). Any person who fails to apply
for business registration shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to a fine of
HK$5,000 and to imprisonment for one year.

LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT

Employment Ordinance (Chapter 57 of the Laws of Hong Kong) (“EO”)

The EO regulates the general conditions of employment and matters connected therein
in Hong Kong. It provides for various employment-related benefits and entitlements to
employees. All employees covered by the EO, irrespective of their hours of work, are
entitled to protection including payment of wages, restrictions on wages deductions and the
granting of statutory holidays. Employees who are employed under a continuous contract
are further entitled to such benefits as rest days, paid annual leave, sickness allowance,
severance payment and long service payment.

Employee’s Compensation Ordinance (Chapter 282 of the Laws of Hong Kong) (“ECO”)

The ECO establishes a no-fault and non-contributory employee compensation system
for work injuries and lays down the rights and obligations of employers and employees in
respect of injuries or deaths caused by accidents arising out of and in the course of
employment, or by prescribed occupational diseases. Under the ECO, if an employee
sustains an injury or dies as a result of an accident arising out of and in the course of his
employment, his employer is in general liable to pay compensation even if the employee
might have committed acts of faults or negligence when the accident occurred. Similarly, an
employee who suffers incapacity or dies arising from an occupational disease is entitled to
receive the same compensation as that payable to employees injured in occupational
accidents.

According to section 40 of the ECO, all employers are required to take out insurance
policy to cover their liabilities both under the ECO and at common law for injuries at work
in respect of all employees (including full-time and part-time employees) for an amount not
less than the applicable amount specified under the ECO. An employer who fails to comply
with the ECO to secure an insurance cover is liable on conviction upon indictment to a fine
at level 6 (currently at HK$100,000) and to imprisonment for two years, and on summary
conviction to a fine at level 6 (currently at HK$100,000) and to imprisonment for one year.
