SUMMARY

Our Innovation

Since our inception, we have successfully expanded our global footprint, using
consumer electronics as our initial entry point. We have consistently demonstrated market
agility to market demand, having launched products in the new energy sector and
established a strong presence in the field of new energy transformer equipment. Leveraging
our high-quality products, we have expanded our business continuously, accumulating a
portfolio of quality customers globally and building scaled manufacturing capabilities. By
strategically replicating our product advantages into additional high-growth industries, we
have further extended our reach into the data center sector. Simultaneously, we have
broadened our product range across the industry value chain, expanding from
core-component supply to complete-equipment sales, thereby forming our current
multi-sector product portfolio.

Our technological capability spans multiple dimensions, with intellectual property
protection sought for all our key R&D achievements. Our patent coverage extends across
critical areas including product design, manufacturing processes and automation
equipment. As of September 30, 2025, we held 542 patents in Chinese Mainland,
including 189 new patents added during the first nine months of 2025. For the years of
2023, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our R&D expenditure
represented 5.1%, 4.2% and 4.6% of revenue, respectively.

Our Global Footprint

Our global footprint encompasses a comprehensive deep-localization strategy covering
areas of production, sales and services. As of September 30, 2025, we operated nine
manufacturing facilities worldwide, including overseas sites situated in the U.S., Mexico,
Malaysia and Thailand; and Chinese Mainland facilities in Ji’an (Jiangxi), Foshan
(Guangdong), Huainan (Anhui), Shenzhen (Guangdong) and Zhongshan (Guangdong).
We have established scaled capacity deployment globally, and we have significantly
enhanced our delivery certainty whilst compressing delivery lead-time. Our smart
transformer manufacturing facility in the U.S., commenced operations in October 2025;
and together with our Mexican production capacity, will form our localized supply
capabilities serving the North American market. In addition, our Malaysian and Thailand
facilities are both in operation. These Southeast Asian sites, together with our North
American and Chinese Mainland manufacturing bases, have created manufacturing
synergies that confer exceptional flexibility enabling our dynamic global capacity
allocation, based on customer location, order requirements and cost efficiency, thereby
strengthening our highly resilient supply chain system.

We have built fully autonomous sales networks in our key overseas markets. As of
September 30, 2025, we had established our directly-owned sales subsidiaries in North
America, Europe, Southeast Asia and other regions, assembling localized sales teams
well-versed in local market conventions, cultures and customer requirements, as well as
establishing a comprehensive local after-sales service system under our direct management.
