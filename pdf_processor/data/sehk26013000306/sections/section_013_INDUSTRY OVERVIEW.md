OVERVIEW OF GLOBAL POWER EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY

The power equipment industry primarily encompasses key equipment used for
electricity generation, transmission, conversion, regulation, distribution, and protection,
including transformer equipment, power supply systems, distribution devices, and
associated control components. Among these, transformer equipment serves as critical
hubs for voltage level conversion and power quality stabilization, forming the foundational
link that ensures the safe operation of various loads. Power supply systems handle
rectification, voltage stabilization, and energy management, providing continuous, reliable,
and efficient electrical support to end-use equipment. Core power equipment collectively
forms the electrical backbone of industrial control systems, renewable energy
infrastructure, and data centers, with performance directly determining downstream
system safety, energy efficiency, and operational stability.

By 2024, the global power equipment market had reached approximately RMB 8.5
trillion. With the accelerated transition of the global energy structure, demand for power
equipment in applications such as renewable energy grid integration, energy storage system
dispatch, industrial automation control, and data centers is expected to grow rapidly. The
market of global power equipment is projected to exceed RMB12.0 trillion by 2030,
representing a CAGR of over 7.0% during the period from 2024 to 2030.

Driven by the expansion of AI computing clusters, the proliferation of
high-power-density cabinets, and stringent power quality requirements, traditional
decentralized power equipment faces bottlenecks of low efficiency, high redundancy, and
large spatial footprint. As a result, transformer equipment and power supply systems are
increasingly integrated with inductors, switchgear, and other related devices to form highly
integrated, complete power solutions. These integrated systems enable efficient energy
conversion, flexible load management, and intelligent monitoring, thereby improving
energy utilization efficiency and operational reliability in computing facilities. Leveraging
accumulated expertise in power electronics, system integration, and global delivery
networks, leading companies are expanding from individual devices to systematic
solutions, gaining first-mover advantages in the next-generation power infrastructure.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

It is estimated that global electricity demand will exceed 35,000 TWh by 2030, driving
cumulative grid investment beyond USD2,000 billion and providing long-term demand
support for power infrastructure upgrades. Transformer equipment is therefore evolving
toward higher power density, lower losses, intelligent monitoring, and liquid cooling
solutions to enable efficient power supply and real-time control. At the same time, the
expansion of emerging scenarios such as EV charging networks, energy storage systems, and
hydrogen energy facilities continues to drive innovation in transformer equipment design,
materials, and system integration, further broadening the industry’s application scope and
technological depth.

Value Chain Analysis of Transformer Equipment Industry

The transformer equipment industry value chain consists primarily of three segments:
upstream raw material supply, midstream transformer equipment design, manufacturing
and integration, and downstream applications.

The upstream segment mainly comprises raw material suppliers. Key materials include
copper, aluminium, electromagnetic wire, silicon steel sheets, and insulation materials,
which provide standardized, stable, and high-performance inputs for transformer
equipment manufacturing while driving midstream equipment performance upgrades
through ongoing material innovation.

The midstream segment consists of transformer equipment providers responsible for
product design, manufacturing, and system integration. This segment represents a part of
the value chain where technological barriers are relatively high and value is relatively
concentrated. Companies in this segment typically require long-term capabilities in
electromagnetic design, power density control, reliability validation, and large-scale
delivery. On this basis, leading enterprises leverage solid R&D and manufacturing
foundations to continuously enhance adaptability to complex loads and multi-application
scenarios through high integration and intelligent upgrades of core transformer equipment,
further deepening the application of transformer equipment in areas such as new energy
charging piles and energy storage systems, supporting stable and efficient power supply
across diverse application scenarios.

Downstream segments include application scenarios such as new energy, data centers,
industrial manufacturing, and power grids. Data centers, driven by rising computing
density and rapid expansion in electricity consumption, are becoming major growth drivers
for high-efficiency, low-loss transformer equipment. In the meantime, the large-scale
deployment of renewable energy power generation including PV and wind power as well as
supporting energy storage systems has further elevated the requirements for transformer
equipment in terms of energy efficiency and stability. As global electrification levels rise and
energy systems accelerate toward low-carbon and intelligent transformation, transformer
equipment penetration across emerging application scenarios is expected to further
increase.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

. Full Value Chain Barrier

Covering magnetic materials, power devices, system integration, and O&M services,
leading companies build vertical integration capabilities across the full value chain. They
control from raw materials to component processing, system design, and complete delivery,
while extending solutions to energy storage and charging infrastructure, forming
cross-segment service barriers.

. Customer Barrier

Power equipment directly impacts power system safety. Clients impose stringent
certification, testing, and life-cycle requirements, and suppliers typically require several
years to enter the supply chain. Through long-term, project-based collaborations, leading
companies have established deep partnerships with clients, and are capable of providing
customized solutions.

. Global Supply Barrier

Serving Europe, the Americas, Middle East, and Southeast Asia requires compliance
with regional standards and energy certifications. Leading companies rely on overseas
factories and local teams to deliver quickly and provide local service, enhancing trust and
responsiveness.

. Product Innovation and Customization Barrier

With diverse downstream applications, products evolve from standard units to
integrated, modular, and intelligent systems. Leading companies leverage advanced
electrical design and manufacturing to rapidly iterate and customize solutions, creating
sustained product barriers.

. Capital Barrier

R&D, raw material procurement, component processing, assembly, and system testing
require substantial investment. Prototyping, lab testing, and long-term reliability validation
also require significant capital. Moreover, global deployment necessitates overseas factories
and service networks. Together, these factors establish high capital barriers for new
entrants.

. Talent Barrier

Core technologies span high-voltage electrical, power electronics, materials, thermal
management, and system integration. Product development and O&M require engineers
with design and field experience. Leading companies cultivate multi-level, cross-disciplinary
teams covering R&D, production, quality, sales, and service, forming a deep talent
advantage difficult for new entrants to replicate quickly.
