New Energy Transformer. Our production process of new energy transformer primarily
includes manufacturing of core components, core assembly and treatment, final assembly
and oil filling, testing and dispatch. The details of the production processes of our new
energy transformer are set out as follow:

. Manufacturing of core components-windings and core. Our manufacturing of core
components begins with the cutting of silicon steel sheets, followed by core
stacking, and core binding and sealing. Subsequently, we proceed with coil
winding. Following winding, we conduct insulation treatment and complete the
process with drying and curing.

. Core assembly and treatment. We commence core assembly by assembling
windings onto core limbs, and then inserting the upper yoke. Subsequently, we
fill any gaps with specified materials and install clamping components to achieve
overall fastening. Following this, we weld and fix leads to terminals and inspect
core cleanliness along with all fasteners. Finally, we employ drying technology to
remove moisture from the materials.

. Final assembly and oil filling. The final assembly phase involves hoisting the core
steadily into the tank, followed by the installation of the tank cover, radiators or
cooling tubes. We then evacuate the tank, and fill it with qualified, dry
transformer oil controlled at a appropriate temperature. After filling, we
continue evacuation for degassing and allow for standing.

. Testing and dispatch. We perform a series of tests including routine testing, such
as, turns ratio testing and electrical testing. Additionally, we conduct leakage
checks by applying pressure. Finally, we complete the process with painting,
installing nameplates, and organizing technical documentation.

components from qualified suppliers. These components undergo rigorous
incoming inspection to verify performance compliance. Concurrently, we
fabricate the enclosure through processes, such as, cutting and welding,
resulting in a sealed, durable housing suitable for harsh outdoor conditions.

. Core assembly and integration. During this stage, we commence assembly by
positioning the fabricated enclosure on the work fixture. We first install auxiliary
systems, including busways and fire protection equipment. We then fix the
inspected and approved core components into their designated positions inside the
enclosure. Following this, we form a complete power pathway by establishing
electrical connections.

. Commissioning and inspection. This critical phase ensures the product’s reliability
prior to dispatch. We begin with electrical inspections. We then conduct
high-voltage testing to confirm absolute insulation integrity. After the foregoing
step, we set up various fault conditions to ensure accurate and rapid protective
responses. Finally, we perform a comprehensive pre-dispatch inspection to ensure
full compliance with customer specifications.

. Packaging and delivery. In the final stage, we apply protective packaging to ensure
safe long-distance transportation. We then arrange shipment of each unit along
with a complete set of technical documentation via specialized transport vehicles
or containers to securely deliver the product to the customer’s specified site, after
which our professional team provides installation guidance and on-site
commissioning services.

. Front-end Assembly. Based on process requirements, components are first formed.
We then complete front-end assembly via either manual insertion or automated
insertion and surface mounting (SMT). An AOI check is conducted during this
stage to verify the quality of component placement and soldering.

. Soldering, Rework and Semi-finished Product Testing. Products proceed to visual
inspection, followed by wave soldering. Where necessary, rework and lead
trimming are performed. After these procedures, another AOI inspection and
semi-finished product testing are carried out. Products that fail the testing are
routed to a repair station for rework.

. Finished Product Assembly and Testing. Qualified semi-finished products are
moved to finished product assembly. Upon completion, they undergo a sequence
of tests including withstand voltage testing, Q40 aging testing, and EMC
(Electromagnetic Compatibility) testing. Each test point incorporates an
OK/NG diversion mechanism to separate qualified and non-qualified units.

. Final Inspection, Packaging and Warehousing. Products that pass the finished
product final testing and Q60 visual inspection proceed to packaging. After
passing QA outgoing inspection, the finished products are transferred to the
finished goods warehouse. This entire process ensures full-cycle quality control
and traceable management.

implement modular and automated production lines, optimize manufacturing processes
continuously, and conduct strict incoming inspections on key raw materials, such as, silicon
steel sheets. We also adopt advanced production and quality control systems to monitor the
production process, thereby supporting stable product performance, Through the
aforementioned quality control measures, we have established a sound quality assurance
system, which supports its long-term cooperation with high-end customers worldwide.

We believe quality is vital to our sustainable business growth and brand image. Our
comprehensive quality management approach encompasses the following key areas:

. Design Quality Management: We ensure compliance of the design process, key
design elements, and product quality at the design stage through design quality
engineering (DQE) quality planning, design reviews, and input and output reviews
conducted during the product development phase.

. Supplier Quality Management: We implement supplier quality management,
including supplier qualification and onboarding, component development,
routine performance evaluation, support and guidance, targeted improvement
initiatives, and rectification measures or disqualification where necessary. This
ensures that all suppliers and materials are lawful, compliant, and meet applicable
standards.

. In-Process Quality Management: We promote employees’ quality awareness
through the principle of “doing it right the first time,” supported by
self-inspection and mutual inspection among employees. This is complemented
by full-process special inspections, including inspections at key positions and
critical-to-quality (CTQ) points, as well as routine patrol inspections to promptly
identify and rectify risks related to personnel, machines, materials, methods, and
environment during production.

. Independent Test Station Management: To ensure that product performance
consistently meets customer and market demands, our test stations are
independently managed, including those certified by the China National
Accreditation Service for Conformity Assessment (CNAS), to ensure the
reliability of test results.

. Quality Management Systems: Our quality management framework is
underpinned by established systems and procedures. We have obtained multiple
system certifications, including ISO 9001 (International standard for quality
management systems), ISO 14001 (International standard for environmental
management systems), ISO 45001 (International standard for occupational health
and safety management systems), QC080000 (International standard for
hazardous substances process management), and IATF 16949 (Global standard
for automotive quality management systems). We establish relevant quality
indicators through management reviews, decompose them in accordance with the
SMART principle, and conduct regular reviews to ensure continuous monitoring
and improvement of quality performance.

. After-Sales Quality Management: We maintain a customer service department
with dedicated after-sales teams in the Americas, Europe, and Japan, providing
global coverage. We collect feedback and market information from customers,
including end customers, and respond to and resolve issues in a timely manner.


-----

BUSINESS

. Continuous Improvement: We uphold a culture of continuous improvement by
identifying and raising issues or risks, proposing improvement suggestions, and
promoting continuous quality enhancement through multi-level and
multi-scenario meetings, such as, daily quality briefings, weekly quality
meetings, monthly quality meetings, and company operational meetings.

. Quality Digital Transformation: We have been establishing full-process quality
files and promoting quality digital transformation, aiming to gradually achieve
full-process digitization, including quality data collection, system upload, data
collation and analysis, and quality early warning systems.

. Quality Recognition and Awards: In recognition of our quality management
capabilities, we obtained authoritative awards in recent years, including the “2023
Foshan Quality Maturity Level 3A Enterprise” and the “2023 Ji’an Municipal
Government Quality Award Nomination Award.”

Warranty Terms and After-Sales Service

Our warranty term is usually 24–60 months commencing from the date of acceptance
upon inspection, subject to customer requirements, and covers product quality-related
issues arising under normal use during the warranty period. In case of product failure
within the warranty period, our Group will arrange for repair or replacement of products
and/or provision of relevant services without extra charge. After the warranty period
expires, our Group may provide maintenance and repair services based on separately agreed
standards. This warranty does not cover damages caused by improper use, unauthorized
modification, neglect of maintenance, natural wear and tear, force majeure, or the use of
non-original accessories. Prior to providing warranty services, our Group reserves the right
to verify the cause of product failure through reasonable means (such as inspection and
testing). If batch defects or systematic failures occur to the same product within twelve (12)
consecutive months (affecting 5% or more of the same model products), upon confirmation,
our Group will provide a replacement plan at our own expense within eight weeks. For
warranty purposes, the Group is also entitled to require the supplier to provide a bank
guarantee equivalent to 10% of the order amount to ensure its fulfillment of warranty
obligations.

We have put in place internal control systems to monitor and ensure the quality of our
products through our quality control team and production team. We regularly perform
equipment inspections and maintenance to ensure our production equipment at optimal
levels. In addition, we perform careful inspections of our raw materials, which provides
further assurance of the quality of our finished goods. However, given the complexity of
production processes, supply chain uncertainties, and the continuous evolution of industry
technical standards, we cannot guarantee that all products will be completely free from
defects or performance deviations under all circumstances. See “Risk Factors — risks
relating to our business and industry — Defects or unsatisfactory performance of our
products, or failure to maintain effective quality control, could result in returns, recalls,
reputational damage, loss of customers and product operations.”.

For details of the Group’s product return and exchange policies with distributors,
please refer to “Principal Terms of Distribution Agreements.

During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we had not
received any material complaints relating to product quality; we had not experienced any
material product returns, refunds or recalls; and we had not been involved in any material
incidents or been subject to any material claims, proceedings or liabilities concerning safety
issues of our products.

TRANSFER PRICING

Our Company’s intra-group transactions during the Track Record Period were
conducted under documented transfer pricing policies benchmarked against the OECD
Transfer Pricing Guidelines, and the transfer pricing analyses supported that the relevant
Group’s transfer pricing arrangements complied in all material respects with the OECD
Transfer Pricing Guidelines and applicable transfer pricing laws and regulations of the
relevant jurisdictions.

Intra-Group Transactions and Transfer Pricing Framework

During the Track Record Period, our Company and our subsidiaries in the PRC and
overseas jurisdictions (including the United States, Malaysia and Thailand) engaged in
various intra-group transactions, such as, sales of products, provision of procurement
support and other services, and intra-group financing. These transactions are regarded as
transfer pricing arrangements and are subject to transfer pricing regulations in the relevant
jurisdictions in which our Group operates, including the PRC.

Our Group has adopted a group-wide transfer pricing framework covering, among
others:

. Design and implementation of transfer pricing policies for key transaction types
(including distribution, manufacturing and service arrangements).

. Internal monitoring and control over tax and transfer pricing matters.

. Periodic reviews and updates of transfer pricing arrangements taking into account
of changes in business and regulatory requirements.

We engaged independent transfer pricing consultants to conduct transfer pricing
analyses and benchmarking for the Track Record Period in 2023, 2024 and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2025. The consultants relied on publicly available financial
data of independent comparable companies obtained through databases (including TP
Catalyst) and industry classifications (including specified SIC codes) to determine
market-based arm’s length ranges of profitability indicators for the relevant transaction
categories and tested entities.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

BUSINESS

For each tested entity and transaction type, the consultants identified the most
appropriate transfer pricing method having regard to the functions performed, assets
employed and risks assumed. The main methods used included:

. Transactional net margin method, using appropriate profit level indicators, such
as, operating margin, return on sales or return on total costs for
distribution/manufacturing type tested parties.

. Benchmarking results and arm’s length assessment.

Based on the benchmarking results for 2023, 2024 and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2025, the independent transfer pricing consultants concluded that the
profitability of the Group’s major tested entities (including the PRC and overseas major
operating entities) in respect of the controlled transactions under review generally fell
within, or in some instances above, the interquartile range of the benchmarking results for
the relevant periods.

Where the profitability in certain individual periods was at or near the lower end of the
benchmark range or showed fluctuations (for example, due to market or cost changes), the
consultants assessed this against multi-year benchmark ranges (e.g. 2021–2023 and
2022–2024 samples) and concluded that there are no material compliance issues with the
overall transfer pricing outcomes for the Track Record Period. On this basis, the transfer
pricing consultants did not identify any material intra-group pricing outcome for the Track
Record Period that was inconsistent with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.

Transfer Pricing Documentation and Compliance

For 2023, 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our Company has
prepared master file and the relevant group entities have prepared local files as required to
meet applicable transfer pricing documentation obligations, including those in the PRC.
The documentation sets out, among others, the group structure, business description,
functional and risk analysis, details of related party transactions, selection and application
of transfer pricing methods and the benchmarking analyses and results.

The transfer pricing analyses were prepared by reference to the OECD Transfer Pricing
Guidelines including the BEPS Actions) as adopted or reflected in the transfer pricing rules
of the relevant jurisdictions.

Our management has been and will continue to be responsible for overseeing and
monitoring our Group’s transfer pricing arrangements. In particular, our management
regularly reviews the reasonableness of pricing policies and the financial outcomes of
related party transactions in light of updated benchmarking and business conditions,
monitors developments in transfer pricing laws, regulations and practice in the PRC and
other relevant jurisdictions and evaluates their potential impact on our Group, and
coordinates with independent transfer pricing consultants on periodic benchmarking
updates and on the preparation of transfer pricing documentation.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

However, we cannot assure that our transfer pricing arrangements will not be subject
to review or challenge by tax authorities in the PRC or other jurisdictions in the future. If
any tax authority were to successfully assert that our Group’s transfer pricing is not in line
with the arm-length principle, our Group could be subject to additional taxes, interest and
penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of
operations. Please refer to the section headed “Risk Factors — Risk Relating to our
Business and Industry — Our financial results may be adversely affected by tax risks
relating to our transfer pricing arrangements.” in this Document for further details.

To the best of our knowledge, all of our five largest customers in each year during the
Track Record Period were independent third parties. As of the Latest Practicable Date,
none of our Directors, their associates or any of our Shareholders (who or which to the
knowledge of our Directors owned more than 5% of our issued share capital) had any
interest in any of our five largest customers in each year/period during the Track Record
Period.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

BUSINESS

During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, as confirmed
by our Directors, save as disclosed below (1) we had no disputes with any Relevant
Customers or Third-Party Payors, nor did we receive any refund requests from them; and
(2) we were not subject to any disputes or administrative penalties from relevant
government authorities arising from the Third-Party Payment Arrangements.

Reasons for Third-Party Payment Arrangements

These customers span both domestic and international markets. Overseas ones come
from countries and regions such as the United States and Malaysia. Regardless of whether
they are domestic or overseas customers, our acceptance of third-party payments is
primarily arranged in response to the customers’ own needs.

The main reasons for these arrangements in our business are as follows:

. For corporate groups controlling multiple subsidiaries, they generally prefer to
make payments through other entities or individuals within the same group for the
convenience of their own treasury management;

. For some customers who had contract disputes with our Group, after the
creditor-debtor relationship was confirmed through judicial proceedings,
payments may be made directly to our Group by a court acting as a third
party, according to the enforcement arrangements stipulated in the legally
effective court judgment documents to settle the transaction amounts pertaining
to the dispute;

. For some customers, a third party may be proactively appointed to make
payments to our Group on their behalf for the convenience of their own payment
operations and to improve settlement efficiency.

Money Laundering Risks Related to Third-Party Payments

Based on the confirmation of the Company’s Directors: (i) the third-party payments
involve genuine transactions between us and the relevant customers and are supported by
commercially reasonable arrangements; (ii) the amounts of the third-party payments we
received from the third-party payers correspond to the transaction amounts stated in the
relevant sales orders, records, and/or invoices between us and the relevant customers, the
third-party payments accepted by us were not intended to circumvent any applicable PRC
tax laws or regulations or other applicable PRC laws and regulations, and we have duly
paid all taxes payable by us in respect of the amounts received from third-party payers in
accordance with applicable PRC tax laws and regulations, and we have not been subject to
any enquiries, investigations or administrative penalties by the relevant governmental
authorities in relation to PRC tax laws and regulations as a result of our receipt of
third-party payments; (iii) we have provided corresponding services to the relevant
customers accordingly; (iv) we have no reason to suspect that the funds provided by the
third-party payers are proceeds of predicate offences or derived from such offences. Based


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

BUSINESS

on the above, and in accordance with the advice of our PRC Legal Advisor, there is a low
risk that our acceptance of payments from third-party payers could result in the incurrence
of corresponding criminal liabilities for money laundering or bribery.

The Company’s Directors believe that the funds for the third-party payments originate
from the relevant customers, as the relevant customers notify us when making payments
and provide us with (i) a payment advice note specifying the invoice numbers being settled;
and (ii) a copy of the bank payment slip as proof of payment. We then cross-check our bank
account records to ensure the amount we received correspond to the invoice amount settled
by the relevant customer. Furthermore, based on the historical settlement records from
long-term relationships with all relevant customers, and the absence of any significant
negative news, reports, or rumors discovered concerning all relevant customers, their
shareholders, and directors, the Company’s Directors believe that all relevant customers are
capable of settling their bills with our Group, and that the transactions with the relevant
customers were not conducted under unusual or unreasonably complex circumstances.
Based on the above, the Company’s Directors believe that the funds for the third-party
payments originate from the relevant customers.

Internal Control Measures for Third-Party Payment Arrangements

To safeguard the interests of our Group against risks associated with third-party
payment arrangements, our Group has implemented the following internal control
measures:

(1) The finance department is responsible for maintaining accounts receivable and
settlement management ledgers, recording information including customer name,
transaction details, payment particulars, payment amount, payment method, and
payer’s name, to ensure that relevant payments are made directly by the relevant
customers;

(2) Our Group has, in principle, ceased accepting third-party payment arrangements
and requires that all new orders must be settled directly by customers from their
own accounts. In exceptional circumstances where direct payment is objectively
not possible, relevant payments may only be accepted solely upon completion of
internal compliance review and approval, strictly in accordance with limited
written procedures, with complete explanatory documentation and approval
records retained.

Considering that revenue generated from our such third-party payment arrangements
as a percentage of our total revenue is low, our Directors confirm that the termination of
such arrangements will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, or operating results.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

BUSINESS

Our Directors are responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of
internal control measures and the effectiveness of the internal control system. In
preparation for this offering, we have engaged independent third-party consultants
(“Internal Control Consultants”) to conduct an internal control review (“Internal Control
Review”) on selected areas of our internal control over financial reporting. The scope of the
Internal Control Review conducted by the Internal Control Consultants covered, among
other things, third-party payment arrangements. Based on the Internal Control Review
performed for the [REDACTED], the Internal Control Consultants reviewed the
aforementioned internal control measures adopted by us concerning third-party payment
arrangements and did not identify any material weaknesses.

SUPPLIERS

Supplier Management

We have established a robust supplier management system that encompasses supplier
onboarding, assessment and exit management to ensure that our supply chain meets our
operational and strategic requirements in terms of quality, cost, delivery, and services. With
respect to supplier onboarding, we have adopted supplier qualification procedures to assess
their capabilities, production capacity, quality control systems, pricing and overall service
performance.For admitted suppliers, we conduct annual or quarterly performance reviews
to ensure their continued compliance with our requirements. For suppliers that fail to meet
our standards (in the event of major incidents or breach of contractual obligations), we will
activate an exit mechanism and, where necessary, implement transitional management and
risk control measures to maintain supply continuity and mitigate potential impacts on our
operations.

Major Suppliers

In 2023, 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, purchases from our
top five suppliers for each period during the Track Record Period amounted to
approximately RMB555.2 million, RMB694.3 million and RMB526.4 million,
representing 20.1%, 20.5% and 19.9% of our total purchase amount of such period,
respectively. The purchase from our largest supplier for each period during the Track
Record Period amounted to approximately RMB159.9 million, RMB174.6 million and
RMB147.2 million, representing 5.8%, 5.2% and 5.5% of our total purchase amount in the
same periods, respectively. We typically settle payments with our top five suppliers by Net

INSURANCE

We have arranged insurance coverage for certain aspects of our operations, including
export credit insurance, overseas equity investment insurance, work safety liability
insurance, group personal accident insurance and employer’s liability insurance. We
believe that such coverage addresses the principal risks encountered in our ordinary course
of business. However, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be
sufficient to cover all potential losses. For further details, see the section titled “Risk
Factors — Risks relating to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital — We
may have limited insurance coverage, which could expose us to additional costs”. We will
continue to review and assess our risk portfolio and will make necessary and appropriate
adjustments to our insurance program based on actual needs and industry practices.
According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, during the Track Record Period and up to the
Latest Practicable Date, Our insurance coverage is commensurate with industry standards.
During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we have not made
any material insurance claims in relation to our operations.

PROPERTIES

As of the Latest Practicable Date, we owned 84 properties with an aggregate GFA of
approximately 610,018.4 sq.m. in China (manufacturing plants, offices, warehouses and
staff dormitory in Guangdong/Jiangxi/Anhui), leased 10 properties with an aggregate GFA
of approximately 42,000.0 sq.m. in China.

Owned Properties

Land

As of the Latest Practicable Date, we owned land use rights for multiple industrial
parcels across China (primarily Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces), with an aggregate site
area supporting production facilities exceeding 500,000.0 sq.m. across key production bases
including Ji’an facility, and other sites used as factories, warehouses, and R&D centers. As

substantially all owned buildings. For certain properties for which the real estate
ownership certificates have not yet been obtained, such non-completion or failure to
obtain the house ownership certificates does not affect the actual use of these properties by
us, nor does it have a material adverse impact on our continuous business operations or
constitute a material obstacle to the offering.

ESG

Upholding a vision for a sustainable future, we fully integrate ESG principles into our
core corporate strategy and decision-making processes. We systematically refine our
governance framework and optimize production and operational practices, striving for
continuous advancement across the ESG dimensions. We are committed to creating shared
value and promoting the synergistic development of economic prosperity, social well-being,
and ecological health. By building long-term resilience and delivering enduring returns for
our stakeholders, we contribute actively to constructing a greener, smarter, and more
sustainable world.

1. GOVERNANCE

1.1 ESG Governance Practices

We have established an ESG strategic positioning of “Green Development
Facilitating Energy Structure Transition, and Dual-Carbon Consensus Driving
Low-Carbon Product Innovation”. We have constructed the “RISE” strategic
framework supported by four pillars: Robust Operations, Innovation-driven
Development, Social Co-benefits, and Environmental Protection, and undertake to
strictly adhere to the ESG information disclosure requirements of the Stock Exchange
upon [REDACTED]. Our ESG policy system encompasses risk identification, strategy
formulation, and mechanisms for the management and continuous monitoring of
ESG-related risks. It explicitly defines methods for setting key performance indicators
(KPIs), management requirements for these indicators, and corresponding mitigation
measures, thereby systematically elevating the Company’s ESG management
standards.

We have established a comprehensive ESG governance and management system.
As the highest governing body for ESG, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) has a
dedicated ESG Committee to oversee related matters, including (i) managing and
making recommendations on the Company’s ESG strategy and issues; (ii) reviewing
ESG-related disclosure documents; (iii) identifying and evaluating ESG-related risks
and opportunities; and (iv) guiding and supervising the implementation of ESG
initiatives, while reporting regularly to the Board. Additionally, the ESG Committee
sets up an ESG Leadership Group and an ESG Management Department, which are
responsible for formulating action goals and plans based on the strategy. An ESG
Working Group has been set up under their supervision to execute specific tasks
assigned by the decision makers and management. The Board and the ESG Committee
hold regular meetings at least once a year to hear ESG progress reports. We also
conduct targeted training sessions covering topics such as ESG themes, to continuously
enhance the Board’s compliance and ESG management capabilities.

1.2 Board Diversity

We attach great importance to Board diversity. In the election of directors, we
consider factors including, but not limited to, gender, age, cultural and educational
background, professional experience, skills and knowledge, length of service, and
independence. Currently, our Board consists of seven directors, comprising two
executive directors, two non-executive directors and three independent non-executive
directors. The professional backgrounds of our Board members span multiple fields,
including accounting, economics, law, and technology ensuring the Board possesses
diverse perspectives and decision-making capabilities.

1.3 Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery

We strictly comply with laws and regulations regarding anti-corruption, including
but not limited to the Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the People’s Republic of China
and the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China. We have established internal
anti-corruption institutions and management measures, upholding high standards of
integrity and maintain a zero-tolerance attitude toward corruption or bribery. We have
established a business ethics management system with the Board as the highest
governing body. The Audit Committee is responsible for leading, supervising, and
coordinating audit and inspection work. The Audit and Supervision Department acts
as the dedicated executive body to independently conduct audit supervision, assurance,
and evaluation, exercising audit authority, and receiving professional guidance and
supervision from internal and external audit departments.

We advocate clear professional ethics to our employees, strictly prohibiting
bribery, extortion, fraud, money laundering, and other unethical behaviors, such as
delaying payments to suppliers, misappropriating Company assets, or
offering/accepting gifts or other improper benefits. We require our employees and
suppliers to sign relevant Integrity Undertakings or Agreements, and to abide by codes
of conduct regarding anti-corruption and anti-bribery. We provide regular
anti-corruption and anti-bribery compliance training for the Board and employees
and conduct “Integrity Awareness Month” activities to foster a strong culture of
compliance. As of the end of the Reporting Period, the Company was involved in two
concluded embezzlement litigation cases; the individuals involved have been held
legally accountable. The Company has communicated the verdicts of these cases
internally to reinforce integrity awareness among all staff and reiterate our firm stance
of zero tolerance toward corruption. We joined the Enterprise Anti-Fraud Alliance in
2022 and were elected as a Council Unit in 2024, actively participating in the
construction of corporate anti-fraud mechanisms.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

BUSINESS

Regarding reporting and complaints, we have established internal reporting
channels. We encourage employees and stakeholders to report any suspected bribery or
corruption via email, telephone, letter, or courier. We stipulate strict confidentiality
for reported matters and complaints to prevent whistleblowers from retaliation or
unfair treatment, thereby ensuring their safety, privacy, and rights.

2. ESG MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

2.1 ESG Material Risk Assessment Mechanism

The effective identification and mitigation of ESG-related risks is critical to our
sustainable development strategy. To align our operational practices with long-term
value creation and strategic objectives, we systematically identify ESG-related risks
that could adversely impact the Company’s business, operating results and financial
conditions. The process integrates the collection, analysis, prioritization, and synthesis
of key concerns raised by our stakeholders, which enables us to evaluate the materiality
of individual ESG issues and formulate targeted management strategies for those
deemed most significant to the Company. We have developed and implemented the
following materiality assessment process:

1. The Company identifies potential material ESG-related risks that may affect
our business or related parties, taking into account the Company’s business
strategy, prevailing international standards, such as the Sustainability
Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) Standards and industry practices.

2. Key stakeholders are invited to participate in surveys to assess their
understanding of, and concerns about, the Company’s material
ESG-related risks.

3. The Company analyzes the collected survey responses and prioritize the
material ESG-related risks.

2.2 Material ESG Risk Assessment and Management Actions

Based on the Company’s business profile and strategic trajectory, we have
conducted a targeted identification and materiality evaluation of ESG-related risks
through our established risk assessment procedures. The evaluation informs our

deployment of targeted mitigation measures across material risk topics, with the
objective of systematically reducing potential impacts. Consequently, we have
identified, assessed, and prioritized the following material ESG risk topics, along
with their potential impacts and corresponding mitigation measures:

Table: Identification and Assessment of Material Risk Topics

Risk Topic Potential Risk Impact Mitigation Measures


Environmental
Compliance
Management

Emissions and
Waste
Management


Failure to comply with environmental
regulations such as standards for
wastewater, exhaust gas, noise
emissions, and specifications for
hazardous waste disposal, during
production and operations may result
in administrative penalties or
litigation, thereby increasing
compliance costs. Furthermore,
environmental violations could lead to
mandatory production halt for
rectification, disrupting operational
timelines, and tarnishing corporate
reputation, and ultimately eroding
competitive standing in the market.

Emissions such as exhaust gases, dust,
and solid waste generated during the
Company’s operations, in the absence
of proper treatment or compliant
disposal, may lead directly to
administrative penalties, fines, or
orders for production suspension and
rectification from environmental
authorities, thereby elevating
compliance costs. Persistent or
significant incidents of emission
exceedances or pollution can severely
damage the Company’s brand image
and reputation, adversely affecting
trust from customers, investors, and
regulators.


The Company applies a tiered
management approach to critical
environmental risks to minimize
the negative impact of our
operations and production on
the ecological environment and
natural resources.

The Company conducts monthly
environmental impact
assessments of emissions and
engages qualified third-party
testing agencies to conduct
assessments on waste gas,
wastewater, and noise emissions.

Climate Change Climate change may exacerbate extreme
Response weather events such as heavy rainfall,
extreme heat, impacting supply chain
stability and the safety of production
facilities. Furthermore, as China
advances toward its
“Dual-Carbon”targets of peaking
carbon emissions by 2030 and
achieving carbon neutrality by 2060,
should the Company fail to drive its
green transition through measures
such as reducing energy consumption
and developing low-carbon products,
it may be exposed to policy
compliance risks, escalating
carbon-related costs, and competitive
disadvantage amid the industry’s
accelerating shift toward
decarbonization.

Energy If the Company fails to manage the
Management energy consumption involved in its
operation such as electricity for air
conditioning and lighting, it risks
aggravating climate change impacts
such as the greenhouse effect and
extreme weather patterns. Moreover,
rising energy prices driven by the
energy transition trend may elevate the
Company’s operating costs.

Water Resource Ineffective water stewardship by the
Management Company would drive up direct costs
for water use and wastewater
treatment expenses, while also
exposing it to fines and production
restrictions due to non-compliance.
Amid mounting water stress and
tightening environmental oversight,
such inefficiencies in water use and
discharge would also undermine the
Company’s green credentials, thereby
diminishing the Company’s
competitive edge in markets where
sustainability performance is
increasingly critical.


The Company has incorporated
climate-related risks and
opportunities into our overall
governance framework. This
integration drives key initiatives
and emission reduction projects
across all product lines. By
prioritizing energy efficiency
enhancements and accelerating
the transition to cleaner energy
sources, these efforts form the
strategic cornerstone for
achieving our climate change
and carbon reduction objectives.

The Company lowers energy
consumption across all its
regions and production sites
through measures such as
implementing energy-saving
retrofits, enhancing building
energy efficiency and promoting
the adoption of clean energy
sources.

The Company regularly analyzes
water usage data across all
processes to identify points of
waste, promotes the “multiple
use of water” initiative, and
fosters a culture of water
conservation awareness across
the organization. Besides, it has
defined clear assessment criteria
and inspection schedules for
water-saving, incorporating
corresponding targets into
departmental KPIs.

Labor Rights Failure to establish legally compliant
labor systems that protect employees’
fundamental rights, including fair
compensation and benefits, reasonable
working hours and leave, and
occupational health and safety, would
expose the Company directly to
immediate penalties from labor
authorities, arbitration proceedings,
or litigation, thereby escalating
administrative and legal expenditures.
Furthermore, discontent regarding
remuneration or workplace conditions
could precipitate the departure of
critical talent, destabilizing production
continuity and impeding the retention
of vital technical knowledge.


The Company explicitly prohibits
the employment of child labor
and any form of forced labor.
The Company also provides
employees with a competitive
compensation and benefits
package alongside a
performance-based incentive
system. Meanwhile, the
Company has set up a Love
Fund Committee to provide
financial support to employees
and their families in times of
need.

The Company has implemented
dual career development
pathways across both
management and professional
track, fostering continuous
learning and growth among
employees. It also offers various
specialized training programs
designed to enhance employees’
personal capabilities and
professional skills, thereby
advancing their career
development.

The Company has developed a
comprehensive framework of
incentives and disciplinary
measures for workplace safety,
which includes routine
monitoring the development of
emergency response protocols,
and the formation of specialized
emergency teams. Besides, the
Company engages third-party
professional agencies at regular
intervals to conduct assessments
of occupational health hazards.


Employee
Development
and Training


The lack of a robust employee training
and career development system can
precipitate talent shortages in critical
technical roles and create significant
skill gaps, thereby impairing
production efficiency and stifling
innovative capacity. Moreover,
constrained pathways for career
progression could diminish employee
motivation, elevate attrition rates, and
ultimately compromise the Company’s
sustainable competitive advantage.


Employee Health Absence of a secure working
and Safety environment and inadequate
cultivation of safety and occupational
health awareness among employees
could result in workplace incidents,
talent loss, and elevated operating
costs for the Company.

Product Quality Insufficient quality reviews and risk
and Safety assessments during critical phases such
as product development, incoming
material inspection, and final product
testing may compromise product
quality. This, in turn, could lead to
diminished customer satisfaction,
product recalls, reduced revenue, and
increased production costs.


The Company has set up a Quality
Incident Emergency Response
Team, which conducts regular
investigations into product
quality incidents and engages
third-party agencies for periodic
supervision and audits to
continuously improve product
quality management. Should any
customer complaints regarding
product quality be received, the
Company will formulate a
product recall plan to diligently
uphold customer rights.

The Company has established an
intellectual property risk
prevention and control
mechanism, standardized the
patent application process, and
provides regular specialized
training on intellectual property
for all employees.

The Company has deployed
comprehensive data backup and
recovery mechanism along with
a multi-layered firewall
infrastructure, and engages
third-party agencies every six
months to conduct security
vulnerability scans on its
internal network.

The Company has implemented a
standardized framework for
managing product after-sales
services. The Company
maintains proactive
communication with customers,
promptly develops and executes
response plans, and provides
timely updates on progress and
outcomes.

A deficient awareness of protecting the
Company’s own and third-party
intellectual property could precipitate
the loss of intangible assets or initiate
intellectual property litigation, thereby
elevating the Company’s operating
costs.

Should the Company fail to maintain
robust controls in data security and
personal privacy protection, critical
business secrets, including business
operations and customer information
could be exposed to leakage risks.
Such breaches would adversely impact
corporate operations and reputation,
potentially reduce revenue and drive
up product and operating costs.

Should the Company be incapable of
effectively capturing and responding
to customer needs and feedback
through diverse channels, or exhibit
declining market sensitivity during
product design and procurement, its
business performance may suffer,
potentially resulting in diminished
revenue.

Sustainable If the Company lacks the capacity to
Supply Chain effectively evaluate and oversee the
sustainability performance of its
upstream suppliers, issues such as
environmental violations, safety
incidents, or labor rights
infringements at the supplier level
could propagate through the supply
chain. This could subsequently lead to
production disruptions, product
quality compromises, regulatory
penalties, and impairment of the
Company’s brand reputation.

Corporate Should the Company fail to implement a
Governance robust corporate compliance
management system, it will be unable
to effectively prevent or oversee
misconduct in its operations. This
deficiency could expose the Company
to significant business and ESG risks,
undermine its operational continuity,
and lead to reduced revenue alongside
higher operating costs.

Business Ethics When the Company engages in business
ethics violations, such as commercial
bribery, unfair competition, fraud, or
intellectual property infringement
during commercial activities, it would
be exposed to immediate litigation,
severe regulatory penalties, and
substantial compensation payments,
which severely damage its reputation
and brand value. Moreover, as such
scandals undermine trust with
customers, partners, and investors,
they can lead to the termination of
business collaborations and a loss of
market share.


The Company integrates ESG
performance metrics into its
supplier management system,
and conducts regular
sustainability audits of
suppliers, with the objective of
identifying and imposing
measures such as suspension,
phase-out, and blacklisting for
non-compliant suppliers.

The Company has established a
management structure
comprising an Audit Committee,
Strategy Committee,
Nomination Committee,
Remuneration and Appraisal
Committee, ESG Committee,
along with well-defined
operating procedures. These
committees hold at least one
regular meeting annually and
conduct periodic systematic
training on compliance and
ESG. Additionally, the current
board members of the Company
possess diverse professional
expertise across multiple fields,
ensuring that decision-making
benefits from comprehensive
professionalism and a
multi-faceted perspective.

The Company has developed a
business ethics governance
framework overseen by the
Board of Directors, strictly
prohibiting bribery, extortion,
fraud, money laundering, and
other unethical conduct. Regular
anti-corruption and anti-bribery
compliance training is provided
to the board and all employees
to cultivate a robust culture of
integrity and compliance.

3. ESG RISK MANAGEMENT

We have established a systematic risk management, compliance and internal control
framework where the Board’s Audit Committee takes overall charge of the risk
management, and the Audit and Supervision Department sets up dedicated positions,
ensuring a clear division of responsibilities and standardized operations for managing the
Company’s operational and ESG risks. The Audit and Supervision Director coordinates the
development and improvement of the internal control system, develops key business risk
profiles, and monitors the implementation across units. The Audit and Internal Control
Manager is tasked with systematically managing operational uncertainties through
end-to-end risk monitoring, assessment, and mitigation. The Supervision Manager
oversees and inspects business activities to assess and mitigate risks, ensuring timely issue
identification and resolution.

In accordance with the COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework, we have
conducted a specialised audit and identified 11 primary risk categories, including internal
control environment risks, economic environment risks, and policy environment risks.
Based on the assessment results, we have begun building a supply chain risk management
system that encompasses risk identification, measurement, and evaluation, supported by
early-warning and emergency response mechanisms. This initiative systematically bolsters
the supply chain’s resilience and risk responsiveness, driving forward the Company’s supply
risk management program and enhancing its overall risk preparedness. As of the end of the
Reporting Period, no material non-compliant incidents related to product quality,
environmental pollution, or occupational health and safety have occurred at the Company.

4. ENVIRONMENT

4.1 Environmental Compliance Management

In our daily operations, we strictly comply with environmental laws and
regulations, including the Environmental Protection Law of the People’s Republic of
China and the Environmental Impact Assessment Law of the People’s Republic of China.
We have established internal management systems and protocols, which together
constitute a comprehensive mechanism for identifying and assessing environmental
aspects. Key identified environmental aspects (such as electricity consumption, raw
material consumption, waste gas emissions, and wastewater discharge) along with their
corresponding management plans and objectives, are assigned to designated
responsible units and individuals with clear deadlines for completion. For each
environmental objective, we conduct at least one annual progress assessment to ensure
the implementation of environmental management tasks. As of the end of the
Reporting Period, no environmental violations, major leakage incidents, or material
penalties related to environmental protection have occurred in the Company.

4.2 Emissions and Waste Management

We strictly comply with relevant laws, regulations, and standards, including the
Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law of the People’s Republic of China, the Water
Pollution Prevention and Control Law of the People’s Republic of China, the Law of the
People’s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution by
Solid Waste, the Standard for Pollution Control on the Storage and Landfill Site of
General Industrial Solid Waste, and the Standard for Pollution Control on Hazardous
Waste Storage. We have established internal rules and regulations regarding emissions
and waste, ensuring that our production emissions and the treatment of waste gas and
solid waste are in strict compliance with all applicable national and local regulations
and policies, thereby minimizing the ecological impact of emissions and waste from our
operations.

We have established a comprehensive environmental control mechanism for waste
gas and waste management. The Company’s EHS team carries out inspections in
accordance with the annual environmental monitoring plan and engages qualified
third-party agencies to conduct testing of waste gas and noise emissions. We identify
all waste gas emission points, rigorously monitor and manage these emissions, and
ensure the proper functioning of our waste gas collection and treatment systems. We
identified and analyzed operational emissions and pollutants involved in the
Company’s operations, set internal emission standards with a corresponding
evaluation mechanism, and developed implementation safeguards to ensure
long-term emission management. During the Reporting Period, the Company’s EHS
team conducted monthly inspections of the environmental impact of emissions aligned
with the annual environmental monitoring plan. These inspections covered
plant-boundary and in-plant waste gas, boundary noise, kitchen fumes, wastewater,
drinking water, and other aspects. All inspection results complied with applicable
standards.

Internally, the Company has defined its waste management target as the
“Compliance Rate for Treatment of Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Waste”. We
implement clear classification and management for both general and hazardous waste,
with defined requirements for categorization, treatment, and transfer. We are
committed to the proper management of all hazardous waste to prevent any form of
environmental pollution.

We promote recycling by channeling recyclable solid waste to a dedicated
warehouse for valuable resources. Once accumulated to a certain volume, the materials
are sold for recycling, thereby advancing resource recovery and minimizing resource
waste. Hazardous waste is segregated and collected by category. The indiscriminate
disposal or discarding of hazardous materials, such as waste organic solvents,
activated carbon, batteries, organic resins, and their containers and packaging, is
strictly prohibited. For waste requiring specialized treatment, we engage qualified
third-party contractors for environmentally sound disposal.

4.4 Energy Management

In our daily operations, we strictly adhere to the Law on Energy Conservation of
the People’s Republic of China and related laws and regulations. We have established
an internal energy management system, upholding the principle of “legal compliance,
energy conservation, company-wide engagement, and continuous improvement”, we
standardize energy use and management and actively promote energy conservation and
emission reduction. We are committed to reducing the energy consumption per product
unit by 1% annually. We have effectively lowered energy consumption across all
operational and production sites through targeted initiatives, such as switching to high
efficiency lighting, implementing energy-efficient upgrades to central air-conditioning
systems, phasing out motors with high energy consumption, and enhancing real-time
monitoring and optimization of energy use in production processes.

In terms of energy efficiency in buildings, the Company has adopted green
building materials such as energy-efficient windows and doors and insulation materials
in some of its plants, which has enhanced the thermal performance of building
envelopes while meeting production needs, significantly reducing internal energy
consumption. We have maximized natural light and ventilation in the design of the
plants. Multi-story plants are equipped with extensive glazing and optimized airflow
systems. Production areas make the best use of natural light, with critical production
processes featuring the integration of natural and artificial lighting, while office spaces
rely mainly on natural illumination to minimize energy use. An intelligent zonal
lighting system further improves efficiency through automated lighting control, such as
activating part of lighting fixtures in production areas where necessary, providing
targeted illumination in key areas, and using motion-activated lights in public spaces.

At the same time, we vigorously advocate the use of clean energy, gradually
intensify investment in PV equipment, and increase the proportion of clean energy in
production. These efforts are aimed at reducing carbon emissions. We have replaced
traditional electrical lighting with solar-powered solutions to transition to a green
power supply. We have independently developed charging piles to provide efficient and
convenient charging services for employees with new energy vehicles, thereby further
enhancing the utilization of clean energy.

of water-saving equipment and optimization of water usage processes, we aim to
reduce per capita daily water consumption to industry-leading levels and achieve a
8%-10% reduction in per capita domestic water consumption, and establishing a
long-term, four-pronged water conservation mechanism encompassing “measurement,
management, technology, and awareness”.

Guided by the sustainable development philosophy of “Prioritizing Water
Conservation and Promoting Recycling”, we have established a water use
monitoring mechanism to regularly analyze water consumption data across various
stages and reduce water waste during operations. We conduct regular inspections and
calibrations of water meters, with dedicated personnel responsible for routine
inspections and maintenance to prevent pipeline leaks. We have comprehensively
promoted water-saving appliances in key water-consuming areas such as canteens and
restrooms, achieving full coverage of water-saving appliances in public buildings. In
the canteen, we implement a food cleaning process of “sorting before washing and
soaking before rinsing”, along with a dish cleaning standard of “scraping, washing,
and rinsing in sequence”, to reduce fresh water usage. We have also established water
conservation supervision posts to prevent continuous water flow and limit the use of
high-pressure water guns, opting instead to mop the floors. We continuously enhance
employee awareness of water conservation through the posting of water-saving
slogans, monthly publicity campaigns, and quarterly thematic training sessions.
Additionally, the Company optimizes water use processes by promoting “water reuse”
(e.g., using washing water for toilet flushing), replacing flood irrigation with
drip/micro-sprinkler irrigation, and establishing a monthly water use analysis
mechanism to dynamically track water consumption data across various functional
areas. In production processes, the Company has introduced a comprehensive
circulating water treatment and reuse system to achieve efficient recycling of water
resources and significantly enhance water use efficiency.

Republic of China and the Regulations on the Implementation of the Bidding Law of the
People’s Republic of China, we have established internal supply chain management
measures and procedures, thereby providing an institutional framework for the
standardised governance of the Company’s supply chain operations.

We have imposed strict requirements on the full lifecycle management of suppliers,
covering their development, assessment, and elimination, and incorporated performance
in environmental protection and social responsibility into the supplier management
system. During the supplier development phase, we strictly control the supplier
admission criteria, requiring them to provide basic qualification documents such as
business licenses, production permits, and quality management system certifications.
During the supplier assessment phase, we incorporate sustainability-related standards
such as environmental protection into the evaluation. Their performance is monitored
through monthly or semi-annual assessment focusing on supply quality, delivery
timeliness, and cost. Based on the assessment results, suppliers are classified into four
tiers, with corresponding management measures applied to each tier. We disqualify,
eliminate, or blacklist non-compliant suppliers to optimize our supplier base.

We place a strong emphasis on suppliers’ performance in ESG aspects, conducting
regular sustainability audits on suppliers and issuing audit reports. Suppliers are
categorized into five performance levels — Excellent, Very Good, Good, Needs
Improvement, and Red Zone — based on audit scores, the number of identified
non-conformities, and the risk severity of these non-conformities. This facilitates
differentiated auditing and management approaches. Furthermore, we organize
regular coaching and training sessions for suppliers, designed to address quality
