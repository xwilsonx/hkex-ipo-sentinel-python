The following is the text of a report set out on pages I-[1] to I-[110], received from the
Company’s reporting accountants, Rongcheng (Hong Kong) CPA Limited, Certified Public
Accountants, Hong Kong, for the purpose of incorporation in this Document. It is prepared
and addressed to the directors of the Company and to the Sole Sponsor pursuant to the
requirements of HKSIR 200 Accountants’Reports on Historical Financial Information in

ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT ON HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE
DIRECTORS OF EAGLERISE ELECTRIC & ELECTRONIC (CHINA) CO., LTD. AND
GUOTAI JUNAN CAPITAL LIMITED

Introduction

We report on the historical financial information of Eaglerise Electric & Electronic
(China) Co., Ltd. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, the “Group”) set out on
pages I-[4] to I-[110], which comprises the consolidated statements of financial position of
the Group as at December 31, 2023 and 2024, the statements of financial position of the
Company as at December 31, 2023 and 2024 and the consolidated statements of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statements of changes in equity and the
consolidated statements of cash flows of the Group for each of the years ended
December 31, 2023 and 2024 and material accounting policy information and other
explanatory information (together, the “Historical Financial Information”). The Historical
Financial Information set out on page I-[4] to I-[110] forms an integral part of this report,
which has been prepared for inclusion in the document of the Company dated [‧] (the
“Document”) in connection with the initial [REDACTED] of H shares of the Company on
the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.

Directors’ responsibility for the Historical Financial Information

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Historical
Financial Information that gives a true and fair view in accordance with the basis of
presentation and preparation set out in Note 2 to the Historical Financial Information, and
for such internal control as the directors of the Company determine is necessary to enable
the preparation of the Historical Financial Information that is free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Reporting accountants’ responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Historical Financial Information and
to report our opinion to you. We conducted our work in accordance with Hong Kong
Standard on Investment Circular Reporting Engagements 200, “Accountants’ Reports on
Historical Financial Information in Investment Circulars” issued by the Hong Kong
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”). This standard requires that we

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

comply with ethical standards and plan and perform our work to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the Historical Financial Information is free from material
misstatement.

Our work involved performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the Historical Financial Information. The procedures selected depend on the
reporting accountants’ judgement, including the assessment of risks of material
misstatement of the Historical Financial Information, whether due to fraud or error. In
making those risk assessments, the reporting accountants consider internal control relevant
to the entity’s preparation of Historical Financial Information that gives a true and fair
view in accordance with the basis of presentation and preparation set out in Note 2 to the
Historical Financial Information in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control. Our work also included evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the
directors of the Company, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Historical
Financial Information.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the Historical Financial Information gives, for the purpose of the
accountants’ report, a true and fair view of the Group’s consolidated financial position as at
December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company’s financial position as at December 31, 2023 and
2024, and of the consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows of the
Group for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024 in accordance with the basis of
presentation and preparation set out in Note 2 to the Historical Financial Information.

Review of stub period financial information

We have reviewed the stub period financial information of the Group which comprises
the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group as at September 30, 2025 and
the statement of financial position of the Company as at September 30, 2025, the
consolidated statements of comprehensive income, the consolidated statements of changes
in equity and the consolidated statements of cash flows of the Group for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2025, and other explanatory information (the “Stub Period
Financial Information”).

The directors of the Company are responsible for the presentation and preparation of
the Stub Period Financial Information in accordance with the basis of presentation and
preparation set out in Note 2 to the Historical Financial Information. Our responsibility is
to express a conclusion on the Stub Period Financial Information based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements
2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of
the Entity” issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board
(“IAASB”). A review consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for

financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A
review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in
an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Based on our review, nothing
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Stub Period Financial
Information, for the purposes of the accountants’ report, is not prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with the basis of presentation and preparation set out in Note 2 to
the Historical Financial Information.

Report on matters under the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange
of Hong Kong Limited (the “Listing Rules”) and the Companies (Winding Up and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance

Adjustments

In preparing the Historical Financial Information, no adjustments to the Underlying
Financial Statements as defined on page I-[4] have been made.

Dividends

We refer to Note 12 to the Historical Financial Information which contains
information about the dividends declared and paid by the Company in respect of the
years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024

been issued but are not yet effective:

Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its
Associate or Joint Venture[3]

Amendments to IFRS 7 and IFRS 9 Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of
Financial Instruments[1]

Amendments to IFRS 7 and IFRS 9 Contracts Referencing Nature-dependent Electricity[1]

Amendments to IAS 21 Translation to a Hyperinflationary Presentation Currency[2]

1 Effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2026
2 Effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027
3 Effective dates not yet determined

Except for new IFRS Accounting Standards mentioned below, the directors of the Company anticipate
that the application of all the other new and amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards will have no material
impact on the Historical Financial Information of the Group in the foreseeable future.

IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements

IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements, which sets out requirements on
presentation and disclosures in financial statements, will replace IAS 1 Presentation of Financial
Statements. This new IFRS Accounting Standard, while carrying forward many of the requirements in
IAS 1, introduces new requirements to present specified categories and defined subtotals in the statement
of profit or loss; provide disclosures on management-defined performance measures in the notes to the
financial statements and improve aggregation and disaggregation of information to be disclosed in the
financial statements. In addition, some IAS 1 paragraphs have been moved to IAS 8 and IFRS 7. Minor
amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IAS 33 Earnings per Share are also made.

IFRS 18, and amendments to other standards, will be effective for accounting periods beginning on
or after January 1, 2027, with early application permitted. The application of IFRS 18 has no impact on
the Group’s financial positions and has impact on presentation of the consolidated statements of
comprehensive income.

3.2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

Basis of consolidation

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when
the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated fully from
the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control
ceases.

Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between group
companies are eliminated in preparing the Historical Financial Information. Where unrealised losses on
sales of intra-group assets are reversed in consolidation, the underlying asset is also tested for impairment
from the Group’s perspective. Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been
adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the
consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in equity and
consolidated balance sheets, respectively.

In the Company’s statement of financial position, subsidiaries are carried at cost less any
impairment loss unless the subsidiary is held for sale or included in a disposal group. Cost is adjusted to
reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments. Cost also includes
direct attributable costs of investment.

Merger accounting for business combination involving businesses under common control

The Historical Financial Information incorporate the financial statements items of the combining
businesses in which the common control combination occurs as if they had been combined from the date
when the combining businesses first came under the control of the controlling party.

The net assets of the combining businesses are consolidated using the existing book values from the
controlling party’s perspective. No amount is recognized in respect of goodwill or bargain purchase gain
at the time of common control combination.

Expenditure incurred in relation to a common control combination that is to be accounted for by
using merger accounting is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

The consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income includes the results of
each of the combining businesses from the earliest date presented or since the date when the combining
businesses first came under the common control, where this is a shorter period.

Business combination other than combinations of businesses under common control

Business combinations, other than combinations of businesses under common control, are
accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred is measured at the
acquisition date fair value which is the sum of the acquisition date fair values of assets transferred by
the Group, liabilities assumed by the Group and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for
control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the performance compensation is measured at its fair value and included in
the cost of the relevant assets on initial recognition. The performance compensation that is classified as an
asset or a liability is subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting date, with the corresponding
gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss.

Investments in an associate

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the
power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or
joint control over those policies.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the Historical Financial
Information using the equity method of accounting, The financial statements of associates used for equity
accounting purposes are prepared using uniform accounting policies as those of the Group for like
transactions and events in similar circumstances.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized in the consolidated
statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Group’s share of the profit
or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate. When the Group’s share of losses of an associate
exceeds the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance,
form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognizing its share of
further losses. Additional losses are recognized only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

An investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the
investee becomes an associate. On acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of
the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the
investee is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any
excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the
investment, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss in the period in which the
investment is acquired.

The Group assesses whether there is an objective evidence that the interest in an associate may be
impaired. When any objective evidence exists, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including
goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets as a single asset by
comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its
carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that
forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized in
accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently
increases.

When a group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses resulting from the
transactions with the associate are recognized in the consolidated financial statements only to the extent of
interests in the associate that are not related to the Group.

Foreign currency translation

The Historical Financial Information is presented in RMB, which is also the functional currency of
the Company. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the
financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.

In the individual financial statements of the consolidated entities, foreign currency transactions are
translated into the functional currency of the individual entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the
dates of the transactions. At the end of the reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rates ruling at that date. Foreign exchange
gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from there translation of monetary
assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss.

Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated
at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated (i.e., only translated using
the exchange rates at the transaction date). When a fair value gain or loss on a non-monetary item is
recognised in profit or loss, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised in profit or
loss. When a fair value gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income,
any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised in other comprehensive income.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

In the Historical Financial Information, all individual financial statements of foreign operations,
originally presented in a currency different from the Group’s presentation currency, have been converted
into RMB. Assets and liabilities have been translated into RMB at the closing rates at the end of the
reporting period. Income and expenses have been converted into RMB at the exchange rates ruling at the
transaction dates, or at the average rates over the reporting period provided that the exchange rates do not
fluctuate significantly. Any differences arising from this procedure have been recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated separately in the other comprehensive income reserve in equity.

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment (other than construction in progress as described below) are initially
recognised at acquisition cost and/or manufacturing cost (including any cost directly attributable to
bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the
manner intended by the Group’s management, including costs of testing whether the related assets are
functioning properly). They are subsequently stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Properties in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes are
carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Costs include professional fees and, for qualifying
assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Such properties are
classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for
intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when
the assets are ready for their intended use.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets other than construction in progress
less their residual values using the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follow:

Properties and buildings 5–40 years
Machinery 3–10 years
Transportation equipment 3–5 years
Electronic equipment and other equipment 3–10 years
Leasehold improvements 3–5 years

The land purchased by the Group overseas with permanent property rights is recognised as freehold
land and is not depreciated.

Estimates of residual value and useful life are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of
each year/period for the Track Record Period.

Gain or loss arising on retirement or disposal is determined as the difference between the sales
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to
the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is
derecognised. All other costs, such as repairs and maintenance, are charged to profit or loss during the
financial period in which they are incurred.

Right-of-use assets

Accounting policies of right-of-use assets (other than prepaid lease payments) are set out in
“Leases” below.

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

Prepaid land lease payments (which meet the definition of right-of-use assets) represent the upfront
payment for long-term land lease in which the payment can be reliably measured. It is stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease except where an alternative basis is more representative of the
time pattern of benefits to be derived by the Group from use of assets.

Intangible assets

Acquired intangible assets are recognised initially at cost. After initial recognition, intangible assets
with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment
losses. Amortisation for intangible assets with finite useful lives is provided on straight-line basis over
their estimated useful lives. Amortisation commences when the intangible assets are available for use. The
useful lives are as follows:

Software 5 years
Patent rights 10 years

The assets’ amortisation methods and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of
each year/period for the Track Record Period.

Intangible assets are tested for impairment as described in “Impairment of non-financial assets” below.

Research and development

Costs associated with research activities are expensed in profit or loss as they incur. Costs that are
directly attributable to development activities are recognized as intangible assets provided they meet all of
the following recognition requirements:

(i) demonstration of technical feasibility of the prospective product for internal use or sale;

(ii) there is intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

(iii) the Group’s ability to use or sell the intangible asset is demonstrated;

(iv) the intangible asset will generate probable economic benefits through internal use or sale;

(v) sufficient technical, financial and other resources are available for completion; and

(vi) the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset can be reliably measured.

Direct costs include employee costs incurred on development activities along with an appropriate
portion of relevant overheads. The costs of development of internally generated software, products or
know-how that meet the above recognition criteria are recognized as intangible assets. They are subject to
the same subsequent measurement method as acquired intangible assets.

All other development costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill

Goodwill is initially recognised at cost being the excess of the aggregate of consideration
transferred, the amount recognised for non-controlling interests and the fair value of the Group’s
previously held equity interest in the acquire over the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities acquired.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value
of consideration paid, the amount recognised for non-controlling interests and the fair value of the
Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquire, the excess is recognised in profit or loss on the
acquisition date, after re-assessment.

Goodwill is measured at cost less impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing,
goodwill arising from an acquisition is allocated to each of the relevant cash-generating units (“CGU”)
that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. A CGU to which goodwill has been
allocated is tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the unit may be
impaired.

For goodwill arising on an acquisition in a financial year, the CGU to which goodwill has been
allocated is tested for impairment before the end of that financial year. When the recoverable amount of
the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying
amount of goodwill allocated to the unit first, and then to other assets of the unit on the pro-rata basis of
the carrying amount to each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in profit or
loss and is not reversed in subsequent periods.

Financial instruments

Recognition and derecognition

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the financial instrument.

Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial
asset expire, or when the financial asset and substantially all of its risks and rewards are transferred. A
financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.

Financial assets

Classification and initial measurement of financial assets

Except for those trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component and are
measured at the transaction price in accordance with IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”,
all financial assets are initially measured at fair value, in case of a financial asset not at fair value through
profit or loss (“FVTPL”), plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the
financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets, other than those designated and effective as hedging instruments, are classified into
the following categories:

— amortised cost;

— FVTPL; or

— Fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”).

The classification is determined by both:

— the Group’s business model for managing the financial asset; and

— the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.

Subsequent measurement of financial assets

Debt instruments

Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if the assets meet the following conditions (and are
not designated as FVTPL):

— they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold the financial assets and collect
its contractual cash flows; and

— the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial recognition, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income in profit or loss. Discounting is
omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group’s restricted bank deposits, time deposits,
cash and cash equivalents, trade and notes receivables, other receivables fall into this category of financial
instruments.

Financial assets at FVTOCI — recycling

If the contractual cash flows of the financial assets comprise solely payments of principal and
interest and are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both the collection of
contractual cash flows and sale, subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive
income, except for the recognition in profit or loss of expected credit loss (“ECL”), interest income
(calculated using the effective interest method) and foreign exchange gains and losses. When the
investment is derecognised, the amount accumulated in other comprehensive income is recycled from
equity to profit or loss.

Financial assets at FVTPL

Financial assets that are held within a different business model other than “hold to collect” or “hold
to collect and sell” are categorised at FVTPL. Further, irrespective of business model, financial assets
whose contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest are accounted for at
FVTPL. All derivative financial instruments fall into this category, except for those designated and
effective as hedging instruments, for which the hedge accounting requirements under IFRS 9 apply.

Equity instruments

An investment in equity securities is classified as FVTPL unless the equity investment is not held for
trading purposes and on initial recognition of the investment, the Group elects to designate the investment
at FVTOCI (non-recycling) such that subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in “other comprehensive income reserve” in equity. Such
elections are made on an instrument-by-instrument basis but only be made if the investment meets the
definition of equity from the issuer’s perspective.

The equity instruments at FVTOCI are not subject to impairment assessment. The cumulative gain
or loss in “other comprehensive income reserve” will not be reclassified to profit or loss upon disposal of
the equity investments and will be transferred to retained earnings.

Dividends from these investments in equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the
Group’s right to receive the dividends is established, unless the dividends clearly represent a recovery of
part of the cost of the investment. Dividends are included in “other income” in profit or loss.

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

Impairment of financial assets

IFRS 9’s impairment requirements use forward-looking information to recognize ECL — the “ECL
model”. Instruments within the scope included cash and bank deposits, trade receivables, notes
receivables, and other financial assets measured at amortised cost.

The Group considers a broader range of information when assessing credit risk and measuring ECL,
including past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the expected
collectability of the future cash flows of the instrument.

In applying this general model approach, a distinction is made between:

— financial instruments that have not deteriorated significantly in credit quality since initial
recognition or that have low credit risk (“Stage 1”); and

— financial instruments that have deteriorated significantly in credit quality since initial
recognition and whose credit risk is not low (“Stage 2”).

“Stage 3” would cover financial assets that have objective evidence of impairment at the end of the
reporting period.

“12-month ECL” are recognised for the Stage 1 category while “lifetime ECL” are recognised for the
Stage 2 categories.

Measurement of the ECL is determined by a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses over the
expected life of the financial instrument.

Cash and bank deposits and restricted bank deposits

Cash and bank deposits are considered to have low credit risk because the counter-parties are banks
and have a low risk of default, and have a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in
the near term. Cash and bank deposits and restricted bank deposits are also subject to the impairment
requirements of IFRS 9, while the identified credit loss was immaterial.

Trade receivables and notes receivables

For trade and notes receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECL and
recognizes a loss allowance based on lifetime ECL at the end of each year/period for the Track Record
Period. These are the expected shortfalls in contractual cash flows, considering the potential for default at
any point during the life of the financial assets. In calculating the ECL, the Group has established a
provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience and external indicators, adjusted for
forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

To measure the ECL, trade and notes receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk
characteristics.

For notes receivables measured at FVTOCI, the Group assumes that the credit risk on notes
receivables measured at FVTOCI has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the notes
receivables measured at FVTOCI is determined to have low credit risk at the end of each reporting period.
Notes receivables measured at FVTOCI is determined to have low credit risk if it has a low risk of default,
the borrower has strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term and
adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily,
reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

Other receivables and other financial assets measured at amortized cost

The Group measures the loss allowance for other receivables equal to 12-month ECL, unless when
there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, in which case the Group
recognizes lifetime ECL. The assessment of whether lifetime ECL should be recognised is based on
significant increase in the likelihood of risk of default occurring since initial recognition.

In assessing whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group
compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial assets at the end of each year/period for the
Track Record Period with the risk of default occurring on the financial assets at the date of initial
recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative
information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking
information that is available without undue cost or effort.

In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has
increased significantly:

— an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument’s external (if
available) or internal credit rating,

— significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk, e.g., a significant increase
in the credit spread and the credit default swap prices for the debtor;

— existing or forecast adverse changes in regulatory, business, financial, economic conditions, or
technological environment that are expected to cause a significant decrease in the debtor’s
ability to meet its debt obligations; and

— an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the debtor.

For internal credit risk management, the Group considers an event of default occurs when
information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to
pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking into account any collateral held by the
Group).

Detailed analysis of the ECL assessment of trade and notes receivables, contract assets, other
financial assets measured at amortised cost and trade and notes receivables measured at FVTOCI are set
out in Note 45.

Financial liabilities

Classification and measurement of financial liabilities

The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and notes payables, other payables and accruals,
redemption liabilities borrowings and lease liabilities.

Financial liabilities (other than lease liabilities) are initially measured at fair value, and, where
applicable, adjusted for transaction costs unless the Group designated a financial liability at FVTPL.

Subsequently, financial liabilities (other than lease liabilities) are measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method except for derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments in
hedge relationships and financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, which are carried subsequently at fair
value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when
the financial liabilities is performance compensation in relation to business combination.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

All interest-related charges and, if applicable, changes in an instrument’s fair value that are reported
in profit or loss are included in finance costs or other income.

Accounting policies of lease liabilities are set out in “Leases” below.

Accounting policies of redemption liabilities are set out in “Redemption liabilities” below.

Borrowings

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs. Borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs)
and the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the
effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Trade and notes payables, other payables and accruals

Trade and notes payables, other payables and accruals are recognised initially at their fair value and
subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method.

Contract assets and contract liabilities

Contract assets are recognised when the Group recognizes revenue before being unconditionally
entitled to the consideration under the payment terms set out in the contract. Contract assets are assessed
for ECL in accordance with the policy and are reclassified to receivables when the right to the
consideration has become unconditional.

Contract liabilities are recognised when the customer pays consideration before the Group
recognizes the related revenue. Contract liabilities would also be recognised if the Group has an
unconditional right to receive consideration before the Group recognizes the related revenue. In such
cases, a corresponding receivable would also be recognised.

For a single contract with the customer, either a net contract asset or a net contract liability is
presented. For multiple contracts, contract assets and contract liabilities of unrelated contracts are not
presented on a net basis. When the contract includes a significant financing component, the contract
balance includes interest accrued under the effective interest method.

Redemption liabilities

A contract that contains an obligation to repurchase the Group entities equity instruments for cash
or another financial asset gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the redemption amount,
even if the entity’s obligations to purchase is conditional on the counterparty exercising a right to redeem.
The entity undertakes such redemption obligations as certain preferred rights are granted to the investors
in the entity’s financing process, such redemption obligation is recognised as financial liability initially at
the present value of the redemption amount and subsequently measured at amortized cost with interest
charged in finance costs, and finance cost is recognized in statements of comprehensive loss on effective
interest method.

The Group derecognizes redemption liabilities when, and only when, the redemption obligations are
discharged, canceled or expired.

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

Inventories

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of completion and
applicable selling expenses. Cost is determined using the weighted average basis, and in the case of
semi-finished goods and finished goods, comprise direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate
proportion of overheads.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, demand deposits with banks and short
term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible
into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Bank balances for which use by the Group is subject to third party contractual restrictions are
included as part of cash unless the restrictions result in a bank balance no longer meeting the definition of
cash. Contractual restrictions affecting use of bank balances are disclosed in Note 28.

Leases

Definition of a lease and the Group as a lessee

At inception of a contract, the Group considers whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A lease is
defined as “a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an identified asset (the
underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration”. To apply this definition, the Group
assesses whether the contract meets three key evaluations which are whether:

. the contract contains an identified asset, which is either explicitly identified in the contract or
implicitly specified by being identified at the time the asset is made available to the Group;

. the Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the
identified asset throughout the period of use, considering its rights within the defined scope of
the contract; and

. the Group has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use.
The Group assesses whether it has the right to direct ‘how and for what purpose’ the asset is
used throughout the period of use.

Measurement and recognition of leases as a lessee

At lease commencement date, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the
consolidated statements of financial position. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which is made up
of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the Group, an estimate
of any costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset at the end of the lease, and any lease payments
made in advance of the lease commencement date (net of any lease incentives received).

The Group depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement
date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term unless
the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership at the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses
the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicator exists.

At the commencement date, the Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease
payments unpaid at that date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot
be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.


-----

“WARNING” ON THE COVER OF THIS DOCUMENT

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are made up of fixed payments
(including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable payments based on
an index or rate, and amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee.

Subsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for lease payments made and
increased for interest cost on the lease liability. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease
modification, or if there are changes in in-substance fixed payments.

The Group remeasures lease liabilities whenever:

. there are changes in lease term or in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which
case the related lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a
revised discount rate at the date of reassessment.

. the lease payments change due to changes in market rental rates following a market rent
review/expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the related lease
liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount
rate.

For lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, the Group remeasures the lease
liability based on the lease term of the modified lease by discounting the revised lease payments using a
revised discount rate at the effective date of modification.

When the lease is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset, or
profit or loss if the right-of-use asset is already reduced to zero.

The Group has elected to account for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets using the
practical expedients. Instead of recognising a right-of-use asset and lease liability, the payments in relation
to these leases are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.

Provisions and contingent liabilities

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result
of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Where the time value of
money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expenditure expected to settle the
obligation.

All provisions are reviewed at the end of each year/period for the Track Record Period and adjusted
to reflect the current best estimate.

Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot
be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow
of economic benefits is remote. Possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future uncertain events not wholly within the control of the
Group, are also disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is
remote.

An onerous contract exists when the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of
meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the
contract. Provisions for onerous contracts are measured at the present value of the lower of the expected
cost of terminating the contract and the net cost of fulfilling the contract (which includes both incremental
costs and an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling that contract).

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

Contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination which are present obligations at the date of
acquisition are initially recognised at fair value, provided the fair value can be reliably measured. After the
initial recognition at fair value, such contingent liabilities are recognised at the higher of the amount
initially recognised, less accumulated amortisation where appropriate, and the amount that would be
recognised in a comparable provision as described above. Contingent liabilities assumed in a business
combination that cannot be reliably fair valued or were not present obligations at the date of acquisition
are disclosed as per above.

Share capital

Share capital are classified as equity. Share capital is recognised at the amount of consideration of
shares issued, after deducting any transaction costs associated with the issue of shares (net of any related
income tax benefit) to the extent they are incremental costs directly attributable to the equity transaction.

Revenue recognition

Revenue mainly arises from sales of new energy products, lighting products, power distribution
products, industrial control products, data center products and others.

To determine whether to recognise revenue, the Group follows a 5-step process:

1. Identifying the contract with a customer

2. Identifying the performance obligations

3. Determining the transaction price

4. Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations

5. Recognising revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied

In all cases, the total transaction price for a contract is allocated amongst the various performance
obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. The transaction price for a contract excludes
any amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

Revenue is recognised at a point in time, when the Group satisfies performance obligations by
transferring the promised goods to its customers.

Revenue from sale of goods

Revenue from sale of goods between the Group and its customers generally only includes a
performance obligation for the transfer of goods, which is recognised when the performance obligation
has been satisfied at a point in time.

Revenue for domestic sale of goods is recognised when the products have been delivered to the
customer as stipulated in the contract, and the customer has accepted the goods; it is probable that related
economic benefits will flow to us; the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been
transferred; and ownership of the goods has been transferred.

Revenue for overseas sale of goods is recognised when customs declaration procedures for the
products have been completed as stipulated in the contract and the customs declaration forms have been
obtained; it is probable that related economic benefits will flow to us; the significant risks and rewards of
ownership of the goods have been transferred; and ownership of the goods has been transferred.

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

Government grants

Grants from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance
that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions. When the grant
relates to an expense item, it is recognized as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the costs,
for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is
credited to a deferred income and is released to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income over
the expected useful life of the relevant asset by equal annual instalments.

Impairment of non-financial assets

The following assets are subject to impairment testing:

. Intangible assets;

. Property, plant and equipment;

. Goodwill;

. Right-of-use assets; and

. The Company’s investments in subsidiaries and associate.

Assets with indefinite useful life or those not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least
annually, irrespective of whether there is any indication that they are impaired. All other assets are tested
for impairment whenever there are indications that the asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable.

An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately for the amount by which the asset’s
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting
market conditions less costs of disposal, and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessment of time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.

For the purpose of assessing impairment, where an asset does not generate cash inflows largely
independent of those from other assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the smallest group of
assets that generate cash inflows independently (i.e., a cash generating unit (“CGU”)). As a result, some
assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at CGU level. Corporate assets are
allocated to individual CGUs, when a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, or
otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of CGUs for which a reasonable and consistent
allocation basis can be identified.

Impairment losses recognised for CGU, to which goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially
to the carrying amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets
in the CGU, except that the carrying value of an asset will not be reduced below its individual fair value
less cost of disposal, or value in use, if determinable.

An impairment loss on goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. In respect of other assets, an
impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the
asset’s recoverable amount and only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment
loss had been recognised.

Employee benefits

Short-term employee benefits

Salaries, discretionary bonuses, paid annual leave and the cost of non-monetary benefits are accrued
and recognised in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees. Where payment or
settlement is deferred and the effect would be material, these amounts are stated at their present values.

Pension scheme

Retirement benefits to employees are provided through defined contribution plans. The employees
of the Group’s subsidiaries which operate in the PRC are required to participate in a central pension
scheme operated by the local municipal government. This subsidiary is required to contribute a certain
percentage of its payroll costs to the central pension scheme. Contributions are recognised as an expense
in profit or loss as employees render services during the year. The Group’s obligations under these plans
are limited to the fixed percentage contributions payable.

Housing funds, medical insurances and other social insurances

Employees of the Group in the PRC are entitled to participate in various government-supervised
housing funds, medical insurance and other employee social insurance plan. The Group contributes on a
monthly basis to these funds based on certain percentages of the salaries of the employees, subject to
certain ceiling. The Group’s liability in respect of these funds is limited to the contributions payable in
each year. Contributions to the housing funds, medical insurances and other social insurances are
expensed is incurred.

Termination benefits

Termination benefits are recognised at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the
offer of those benefits and when the Group recognizes restructuring costs involving the payment of
termination benefits.

Share-based employee compensation

The Group operates share-based compensation plans for remuneration of its employees including
share award schemes.

All employee services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based compensation are
measured at their fair values. These are indirectly determined by reference to the fair value of the equity
instruments granted. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of any
non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets and performance
conditions).

All share-based compensation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss over the vesting period if
vesting conditions apply, or recognised as an expense in full at the grant date when the equity instruments
granted vest immediately unless the compensation qualifies for recognition as asset, with a corresponding
increase in the “capital reserve” in equity. If vesting conditions apply, the expense is recognised over the
vesting period based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of equity instruments that
are expected to become exercisable. Estimates are subsequently revised, if there is any indication that the
number of equity instruments expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any adjustment to
cumulative share-based compensation resulting from a revision is recognised in the current period.

Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs incurred, net of any investment income earned on the temporary investment of the
specific borrowings, for the acquisition, construction or production of any qualifying asset are capitalised
during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. A
qualifying asset is an asset which necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended
use or sale. Other borrowing costs are expensed when incurred.

Borrowing costs are capitalized as part of the cost of a qualifying asset when expenditure for the
asset is being incurred, borrowing costs are being incurred and activities that are necessary to prepare the
asset for its intended use or sale are being undertaken. Capitalization of borrowing costs ceases when
substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are
complete.

Accounting for income taxes

Income tax comprises current tax and deferred income tax.

Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, fiscal
authorities relating to the current or prior reporting period, that are unpaid at the end of the reporting
period. They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal periods to which
they relate, based on the taxable profit for the year. All changes to current tax assets or liabilities are
recognised as a component of tax expense in profit or loss.

Deferred income tax is calculated using the liability method on temporary differences at the end of
the reporting period between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and
their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
temporary differences. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences,
tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other unused tax credits, to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit, including existing taxable temporary differences, will be available against
which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from
goodwill or from initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a
transaction that affects neither taxable nor accounting profit or loss and does not give rise to equal
taxable and deductible temporary differences.

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on
investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the
temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable
future.

For leasing transactions in which the tax deductions are attributable to the lease liabilities, the
Group applies the requirements in IAS 12 to the lease liabilities and the related assets separately. The
Group recognizes a deferred income tax asset related to the lease liabilities to the extent that it is probable
that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised and a
deferred income tax liability for all taxable temporary differences.

Deferred income tax is calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply in the
period the liability is settled or the asset realised, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the
end of each year/period for the Track Record Period.

Changes in deferred income tax assets or liabilities are recognised in profit or loss, or in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity if they relate to items that are charged or credited to other
comprehensive income or directly in equity.

APPENDIX I ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

When different tax rates apply to different levels of taxable income, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are measured using the average tax rates that are expected to apply to the taxable income of the
periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

The determination of the average tax rates requires an estimation of (i) when the existing temporary
differences will reverse and (ii) the amount of future taxable profit in those years. The estimate of future
taxable profit includes:

— income or loss excluding reversals of temporary differences; and

— reversals of existing temporary differences.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are presented in net if, and only if,

(a) the Group has the legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts; and

(b) intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.

The Group presents deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities in net if, and only
if,

(a) the entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities; and

(b) the deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate to income taxes
levied by the same taxation authority on either:

(i) the same taxable entity; or

(ii) different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on
a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future
period in which significant amounts of deferred income tax liabilities or assets are
expected to be settled or recovered.

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The preparation of Historical Financial Information requires the use of accounting estimates which, by
definition, will seldom equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the
Group’s accounting policies.

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the entity and that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and judgements that have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are
addressed below.

Impairment of financial assets and contract assets

The loss allowances for financial assets and contract assets are based on assumptions about risk of
default and expected loss rates. The Group uses judgment in making these assumptions and selecting the
inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the Group’s past history, existing market conditions, as
well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each year/period for the Track Record Period. Details of
the key assumptions and inputs used are disclosed in the tables in note 45.

Inventory provision

The Group measures the inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and makes
inventory provision for the obsolete inventory, slow-moving inventory and the inventory of which the cost
is higher than their net realizable value. The net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to
make the sale. Even though the management of the Group has made the best estimate about the inventory
impairment loss predicted to occur and provided allowance for impairment, the impairment assessment
may still be significantly changed due to the change of market situation.

Fair value measurement of financial assets at level 3 fair value hierarchy

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using
valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions
that are mainly based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period. For details of the
valuation techniques, inputs and key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of financial
assets at level 3 fair value hierarchy are disclosed in the tables in note 44.

Income taxes and deferred income taxations

There are many transactions and events for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during
the ordinary course of business. Significant judgements are required from the Group in determining the
provisions for income taxes. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts
that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred income tax
provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

The Group recognizes deferred income tax assets based on estimates that it is probable to generate
sufficient taxable profits in the foreseeable future against which the deductible losses will be utilised. The
recognition of deferred income tax assets mainly involves management’s judgements and estimations
about the timing and the amount of taxable profits of the companies who has tax losses.

Recognition of share-based compensation expenses

Estimating the fair value of share-based payment transactions requires the determination of the
most appropriate valuation model, which depends on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate
also requires the determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the
significant input of expected life of the share incentive granted, expected volatility, and risk-free rate and
making assumptions about them.

For the measurement of the fair value of share-based payment transactions with employees at the
grant date, the Group uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions and models used for
estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in note 36.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets with finite useful lives and right-of-use assets

Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets with finite useful lives and right-of-use assets are
stated at costs less accumulated depreciation or amortisation and impairment, if any. In determining
whether an asset is impaired, the Group has to exercise judgement and make estimation, particularly in
assessing: (1) whether an event has occurred or any indicators that may affect the asset value; (2) whether
the carrying amount of an asset can be supported by the recoverable amount, in the case of value in use,
the net present value of future cash flows which are estimated based upon the continued use of the asset;
and (3) the appropriate key assumptions to be applied in estimating the recoverable amounts including
cash flow projections and an appropriate discount rate. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable
amount of an individual asset (including right-of-use assets), the Group estimates the recoverable amount
of the CGU to which the assets belongs. Changing the assumptions and estimates, including the discount
rates or the growth rate in the cash flow projections, could materially affect the net present value used in
the impairment test.

5. REVENUE AND SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Group’s principal activities are disclosed in note 3.2 to the Historical Financial Information.

Note: Other products mainly included automotive products and communication products.

All revenue from contracts with customers within the scope of IFRS 15 is recognised at a point in time.
For sales of products, the Group has applied the practical expedient in paragraph 121 of IFRS 15 as the original
expected duration of these contracts is one year or less. Consequently, information about remaining
performance obligations is not disclosed.

The operating segment is reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker (the “CODM”). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing
performance of the operating segments, has been identical as the board of directors (the “Board”) that makes
strategic decisions. The Group’s management reviews the performance of the Group as a single operating
segment based on the internal organisation structure, management requirements and internal reporting system.
Accordingly, only entity-wide disclosure, along with the Group’s result and financial position as a whole, major
customers and geographic information are presented.

Notes:

(a) These investments are not held for trading, instead, they are held for long-term strategic purposes.
The directors of the Company have elected to designate these investments as accounted for FVTOCI
as they believe that recognising short-term fair value fluctuations in these instruments in profit or
loss would not be consistent with the Group’s strategy of holding these instruments for long-term
purposes and realising their performance potential in the long run.

(b) Other financial assets represent investments in unlisted entities which are measured at fair value
through profit or loss.

(c) The balance represents notes receivables held by the Group which are issued or guaranteed by
reputable PRC banks with high credit ratings. The notes receivables had a maturity of within six
months at the end of each year/period for the Track Record Period. The notes receivables are
measured at FVTOCI since the notes are held with the business model whose objective is achieved by
both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and the contractual cash flows
are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The Group
believes that the notes receivables do not expose to significant credit risk and will not cause
significant losses due to the bank default. The changes in the fair value of the notes receivables are
minimal due to its short-term nature.

In addition, the Group has discounted certain notes receivables to banks and endorsed certain notes
receivables to its suppliers to settle its payables. The directors of the Company consider the
probabilities on default of the discounted or endorsed notes receivables are limited and the Group
has derecognised the full carrying amount of these notes receivables and the associated trade and
other payables when the notes receivables are endorsed or discounted.

(i) The maximum exposure to the Group that may result from the default of these endorsed and
discounted notes receivables as at December 31, 2023, 2024 and September 30, 2025 are
approximately RMB856,049,000, RMB1,082,705,000, RMB1,604,164,000 (unaudited),
respectively.

(ii) The maximum exposure to the Company that may result from the default of these endorsed
and discounted notes receivables as at December 31, 2023 and 2024 and September 30, 2025
are approximately RMB366,105,000, RMB557,337,000 and RMB528,955,000 (unaudited),
respectively.

Certain notes receivables measured at FVTOCI are pledged as security for the Group’s notes
payables, details are disclosed in note 38 to the Historical Financial Information.

(a) No audited financial statements of this subsidiary for the year ended December 31, 2023 as it’s
newly incorporated and not required to issue audited financial statements under the statutory
requirements.

(b) No audited financial statements were issued for this subsidiary for the years ended December
31, 2023 and 2024 as they were not required to issue audited financial statements under the
statutory requirements of their place of incorporation.

The above table lists the subsidiaries of the Company which, in the opinion of the directors of the
Company, principally affected the results during the Track Record Period or formed a substantial portion
of the net assets of the Group. To give details of other subsidiaries would, in the opinion of the directors
of the Company, result in particulars of excessive length.

All the subsidiaries of the Company are limited liability companies. All subsidiaries have adopted
December 31, as their financial year end date.

None of the subsidiaries had issued any debt securities during the Track Record Period.

Acquisition of subsidiaries

(a) In May 2025, the Group acquired 100% equity interests in Ji’an Yiyuan New Materials Co.,
Ltd. at a consideration of approximately RMB8,714,000 from Foshan MegaMax Investment
Co., Ltd. and Jiangxi Yuandian New Materials Co., Ltd.. This transaction is a business
combination under common control.

(b) In July 2025, the Group acquired 85% equity interests in Jiangxi Yuandian New Materials
Co., Ltd. at a consideration of RMB20,230,000 from independent third party. Goodwill of
approximately RMB11,137,000 was recognised. The fair values of identifiable assets and
liabilities of Jiangxi Yuandian New Materials Co., Ltd. as at the date of acquisition were as
follows:

Included in the goodwill of RMB11,137,000 recognised above is attributable to the synergy of
business expansion, which does not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset
separately under IAS 38 Intangible Assets. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be
deductible for income tax purposes.

The Group incurred no transaction costs for the above acquisition.

Deferred income tax assets should be recognised when it is probable that taxable profits or
taxable temporary differences will be available against which the deferred income tax asset can be
utilised. Temporary differences will not be recognised as deferred income tax assets if management
estimates that they will not be recovered from taxable profits generated from continuing operations
in the foreseeable future.

The Group introduced a third-party supply chain information service platform to provide services to
its suppliers with the Group’s electronic debt certificates. The Group’s payment obligations under the
electronic debt certificates are unconditional and irrevocable, and unaffected by any commercial disputes
between the parties involved in the transfer of the electronic debt certificates. The Group shall not claim
set-off or raise any defense against the payment obligations. According to the agreement, the Group shall
settle the amounts stated in the electronic debt certificates on the payment date. The electronic debt
certificates are transferable and financially viable.

Under supplier financing arrangements, the banks paid suppliers the amounts owed by the Group in
advance of the original due dates. The Group’s obligations to the suppliers are legally extinguished upon
payment by the relevant banks. The Group then settled with the banks within 180 days after the bank’s
settlement. These arrangements may extend the original payment terms.

Carrying amount of financial liabilities that are part of supplier financing arrangements are as

44. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position
are grouped into three levels of a fair value hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability
and significance of inputs to the measurements, as follows:

Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly, and not using significant unobservable inputs.

Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial asset or liability is categorized in its entirety
is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The table below analyses the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value as at December 31, 2023,
2024 and September 30, 2025 by level of the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Such
inputs are categorized into three levels within a fair value hierarchy as follows:

— Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);

— Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2); and

— Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, significant
unobservable inputs) (Level 3).

(a) Fair value hierarchy

As at December 31, 2023, 2024 and September 30, 2025, the financial assets measured at fair value
on a recurring basis by the above three levels were analysed below:

Interest rate risk

The Group’s interest rate risk primarily arises from long-term interest-bearing borrowings, and lease
liabilities. Long-term borrowings issued at floating rates, and lease liabilities bearing fixed rates expose
the Group to fair value interest rate risk.

The Group has been monitoring the level of interest rates. The increase in the interest rates will
increase the interest costs of borrowings at variable rates, which will further impact the performance of the
Group.

The following tables list out the interest rate profiles of the Group’s variables interest-bearing
financial instruments as at December 31, 2023 and 2024 and September 30, 2025:

Floating rate instruments
— Borrowings 26,042 330,489 527,457

If interest rates of floating rate instruments had been 100 basis points higher/lower with all other
variables held constant, the profit before income tax would be lower/higher approximately RMB260,000,
RMB3,305,000 and RMB5,274,000 (unaudited) for the years ended at December 31, 2023, 2024 and the
nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.

Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk that the counter-party to a financial instrument would fail to discharge
its obligation under the terms of the financial instrument and cause a financial loss to the Group. The
Group’s exposure to credit risk mainly arises from granting credit to customers in the ordinary course of
its operations and from its investing activities.

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each
financial asset measured at amortized cost and trade and notes receivables measured at FVTOCI as
disclosed in note 44 to the Historical Financial Information. The Group does not hold any collateral or
other credit enhancements to cover its credit risks associated with its financial assets.

As at December 31, 2023, 2024 and September 30, 2025, The Group have no credit risk other than
financial assets whose carrying amounts best represent the maximum exposure to credit risk.

(a) Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and restricted bank deposits

To manage risk arising from cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, the Group only transacts
with state-owned or reputable financial institutions. There has been no recent history of default in relation
to these financial institutions. These instruments are considered to have low credit risk because they have
a low risk of default and the counterparties have a strong capacity to meet their contractual cash flow
obligations in the near term. Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and restricted bank deposits are
also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, while the identified credit loss was immaterial.

(b) Trade receivables, notes receivables, notes receivables measured at FVTOCI and contract assets

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade and notes receivables. To measure the expected credit losses,
trade and notes receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and ageing.

The expected loss rates are based on the credit rating of counter parties and the payment profiles of
sales and probability of default of counter parties on an ongoing basis throughout each year/period for the
Track Record Period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking
information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The
Group has identified the Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) Growth Rate and the Money Supply (“M2”)
Growth Rate to be the most relevant factor, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on
expected changes in these factors.

Individually impaired trade and notes receivables are related to customers who are experiencing
unexpected economic difficulties. The Group expects that the amounts of the receivables will partially or
entirely have difficulty to be recovered and has recognised impairment losses.

The Group’s trade receivables as described in note 26 mainly represented receivables received from
the sales of products to customers.

Trade receivables

The Group groups its receivables portfolios based on common credit risk characteristics.

As of December 31, 2023, 2024 and September 30, 2025, the allowance for impairment for the
trade receivables were determined as follows.

Gross carrying Allowance for Expected loss

Assessed based on common credit risk 1,237,862 27,806 2.25

As at September 30, 2025 (unaudited)
Assessed based on common credit risk
(unaudited) 1,663,102 38,058 2.29

Notes receivables

As at December 31, 2023 and 2024, and September 30, 2025, the notes receivables of
RMB127,998,000, RMB291,922,000 and RMB29,662,000 (unaudited), set out in note 26, are all the
banker’s acceptances. The Group measured provisions for impairment of the notes receivables based
on the lifetime ECL and assessed that there was no significant credit risk associated with its bank
acceptance notes issued by large-size banks as the Group did not expect that there would be any
significant losses from non-performance by these reputable banks.

Based on historical experiences and consideration of forward-looking information, other
receivables from related parties were settled within 12 months after upon maturity hence the ECL is
minimal. The impairment on other receivables as stated in note 23 to the Historical Financial
Information were accounted as amortised cost is measured as either 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL.
On such basis, the following table sets forth the impairment for other receivables as at December 31,
2023 and 2024 and September 30, 2025:
