USE OF [REDACTED]

We estimate the net [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED], assuming an [REDACTED]
of HK$[REDACTED] per [REDACTED] (being the mid-point of the [REDACTED] range
stated in this Document), will be approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, after
deduction of [REDACTED] and commissions and estimated expenses payable by us in
connection with the [REDACTED] and assuming the [REDACTED] is not exercised.

We intend to use the [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED] for the following purposes,
subject to changes with respect to our evolving business needs and changing market
conditions:

. Approximately [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED], or HK$[REDACTED], will
be utilized to implementing our overseas expansion and global sales network
construction. This will be used to enhance our global brand influence and
strengthen our comprehensive competitiveness in overseas markets. Based on the
foregoing, we believe that further investment in overseas sales teams and localized
service systems will help consolidate our existing overseas market presence,
enhance customer retention, strengthen our pricing capability and market
responsiveness in overseas markets, and support the continued expansion of our
overseas business.

. Approximately [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED], or HK$[REDACTED], will
be utilized to the digital and intelligent upgrade of our domestic and overseas
manufacturing facilities. These proceeds are intended to align with the global
energy transition trend to achieve a strategic upgrade in smart manufacturing
capabilities — from automated equipment to intelligent systems, and address the
surge in market demand brought by the global energy transition and the inevitable
trend of manufacturing towards flexibility, green development, and intelligence.
Traditional manufacturing models struggle to meet the extreme requirements for
production efficiency, product consistency, and rapid response. Investing in
advanced manufacturing capabilities centered on digital twin is our strategic
choice to transition from “equipment automation” to “system intelligence.” We
plan to build core competitive barrier by building digital twin factories that create
real-time mapping and two-way interactive digital models with physical factories,
covering the entire life cycle from design and production to O&M, effectively
improving Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and shortening production
cycles. Through AI applications, we will deploy algorithms in specific scenarios
like AOI, predictive maintenance, optimization of production process parameters,
and intelligent energy scheduling to shift from “experience-driven” to
“data-driven” decision-making, significantly improving first-pass yield and
reducing quality-related costs. Through the application of industrial simulation
technologies, we conduct digital simulations in areas including new production

FUTURE PLANS AND USE OF [REDACTED]

line layout, logistics routing, and production scheduling optimization. This
enables virtual validation and refinement of solutions prior to physical
implementation, substantially lowering trial-and-error costs and lead times.
Collectively, these initiatives will enhance the precision and foresight of
management decisions and strengthen our factories’s flexible manufacturing
capabilities to respond effectively to demand volatility.

This allocation is further broken down as follows:

(1) Approximately [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED], or HK$[REDACTED], will
be utilized to promote the digital upgrade of our domestic manufacturing
facilities. We have introduced and integrated core information systems, such as,
ERP, APS, MES and WMS into our production operations, enabling end-to-end
digital management from sales orders and production scheduling to product
delivery. Through real-time collection and analysis of production progress,
process parameters and quality data, our manufacturing processes have achieved
visualization, traceability and optimization. We believe that continued
advancement of intelligent manufacturing systems centered on digital twins will
further improve production efficiency, shorten delivery cycles and enhance our
factories’ flexible response to order fluctuations, thereby providing stable and
efficient manufacturing support for the Group’s scalable development. In
particular:

i. Approximately [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED], or HK$[REDACTED],
will be utilized for digital factory infrastructure upgrades, including
necessary automated production equipment, intelligent logistics facilities,
and industrial-grade network and data infrastructure, to strengthen the
foundational capabilities for digital and intelligent operations.

ii. Approximately [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED], or HK$[REDACTED],
will be utilized for the deployment and implementation of digital factory
software systems and personnel training, to enhance system utilization
efficiency and ensure that digital capabilities are effectively applied and
continuously optimized.

iii. Approximately [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED], or HK$[REDACTED],
will be utilized for the implementation and development of key application
scenarios, promoting the practical deployment and application of intelligent
manufacturing technologies in production processes.

iv. Approximately [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED], or HK$[REDACTED],
will be utilized as operating and maintenance expenses and risk reserves for
digital factories, to address uncertainties arising from technological changes
and project delays and to ensure the steady advancement of digital upgrade
projects.

(2) Approximately [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED], or HK$[REDACTED], will
be utilized to promote the digital upgrade of our overseas manufacturing
facilities, to enhance overseas production and operation efficiency and
strengthen coordination across our global manufacturing system. The overseas
production base established by us in Thailand forms a globally coordinated
production capacity layout with our domestic facilities in China. By front-loading
capacity into target markets, we have achieved positive results in shortening
delivery cycles and enhancing supply chain stability. Based on this, we plan to
replicate and roll out domestically proven digital manufacturing experience and
management systems to overseas factories, helping to realize unified management
and coordinated operations of our global production system, further improving
operational efficiency and delivery certainty of overseas factories and enhancing
the resilience and flexibility of the Group’s overall supply chain. The specific
investment will be applied to the following aspects: overseas digital factory
infrastructure upgrades to support automated and intelligent production
requirements; the deployment, implementation and related personnel training of
overseas digital factory software systems; the implementation and development of
application scenarios for advanced intelligent manufacturing productivity in the
transformer industry; and the digital factory-related services and risk reserves to
address uncertainties during technological upgrades and project implementation.

. Approximately [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED], or HK$[REDACTED], will
be utilized to the research, development and industrialization of next-generation
solid-state transformers (SST) and Panama power systems, with the aim of
strengthening technological barriers in the power electronics field and enhancing
core product R&D and scalable manufacturing capabilities. Leveraging our
long-standing technical accumulation in power electronics, electromagnetic
technologies and transformer equipment, we have actively deployed
next-generation power electronic technologies such as solid-state transformers
and have commenced R&D of SST-related products. Meanwhile, we continue to
