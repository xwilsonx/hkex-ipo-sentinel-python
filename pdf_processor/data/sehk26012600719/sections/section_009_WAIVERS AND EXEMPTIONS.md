In preparation for the [REDACTED], we have sought the following waivers from strict
compliance with the Listing Rules and exemption from the CWUMPO.

**WAIVER IN RESPECT OF MANAGEMENT PRESENCE IN HONG KONG**

Pursuant to Rules 8.12 and 19A.15 of the Listing Rules, an issuer must have sufficient
management presence in Hong Kong. This will normally mean that at least two of its executive
directors must be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong. We do not have sufficient management
presence in Hong Kong for the purposes of Rule 8.12 and Rule 19A.15 of the Listing Rules.

Our Group’s management headquarters, senior management, business operations and
assets are primarily based outside Hong Kong. The Directors consider that the appointment of
executive directors who will be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong would not be beneficial to,
and appropriate for, our Group and therefore would not be in the best interests of our Company
or the Shareholders as a whole. Therefore, our Company does not, and does not contemplate
in the foreseeable future that we will, have sufficient management presence in Hong Kong for
the purpose of satisfying the requirements under the Listing Rules.

Accordingly, we have applied for, and the Stock Exchange [has granted], a waiver from
strict compliance with Rules 8.12 and 19A.15 of the Listing Rules. We will ensure that there
is an effective channel of communication between the Stock Exchange and us by way of the
following arrangements:

(i) pursuant to Rule 3.05 of the Listing Rules, we have appointed and will continue to
maintain two authorized representatives who shall act at all times as the principal
channel of communication with the Stock Exchange. Each of our authorized
representatives will be readily contactable by the Stock Exchange by telephone,
facsimile and/or e-mail to deal promptly with enquiries from the Stock Exchange,
and will also be available to meet with Stock Exchange to discuss any matter within
a reasonable period of time upon request of the Stock Exchange. Both of our
authorized representatives are authorized to communicate on our behalf with the
Stock Exchange. At present, our two authorized representatives are Mr. WENG
Huaqiang, an executive Director and secretary of the Board, and Ms. HO Sze Wah,
Cecilia of Global Entity Compliance at Computershare Hong Kong Investor
Services;


-----

(ii) pursuant to Rule 3.20 of the Listing Rules, each Director will provide their contact
information to the Stock Exchange and to the authorized representatives. This will
ensure that the Stock Exchange and the authorized representatives should have
means for contacting all Directors promptly at all times as and when required;

(iii) we will endeavor to ensure that each Director who is not ordinarily resident in Hong
Kong possesses or can apply for valid travel documents to visit Hong Kong and can
meet with the Stock Exchange within a reasonable period; and

(iv) pursuant to Rule 3A.19 of the Listing Rules, we have retained the services of Altus
Capital Limited as compliance adviser (the “Compliance Adviser”), who will act as
an additional channel of communication with the Stock Exchange. We will ensure
that the Compliance Adviser will have access at all times to our authorized
representatives, our Directors and other officers. We shall also ensure that such
persons will promptly provide such information and assistance as the Compliance
Adviser may need or may reasonably request in connection with the performance of
the Compliance Adviser’s duties as set forth in Chapter 3A of the Listing Rules. We
shall ensure that there are adequate and efficient means of communication among
our Company, our authorized representatives, our Directors, and other officers and
the Compliance Adviser, and will keep the Compliance Adviser fully informed of all
communications and dealings between us and the Stock Exchange.

**WAIVER IN RESPECT OF JOINT COMPANY SECRETARIES**

Pursuant to Rules 3.28 and 8.17 of the Listing Rules, the company secretary must be an
individual who, by virtue of their academic or professional qualifications or relevant
experience, is, in the opinion of the Stock Exchange, capable of discharging the functions of
the company secretary.

Pursuant to Note 1 to Rule 3.28 of the Listing Rules, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
considers the following academic or professional qualifications to be acceptable:

(i) a member of The Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute;

(ii) a solicitor or barrister as defined in the Legal Practitioners Ordinance (Chapter 159
of the Laws of Hong Kong); and

(iii) a certified public accountant as defined in the Professional Accountants Ordinance
(Chapter 50 of the Laws of Hong Kong).

Pursuant to Note 2 to Rule 3.28 of the Listing Rules, in assessing the “relevant
experience”, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will consider the individual’s:

(i) length of employment with the issuer and other issuers and the roles he/she played;


-----

benefited from the assistance of Ms. Ho for the preceding three years, will have acquired the
skills necessary to carry out the duties of company secretary and the relevant experience within
the meaning of Note 2 to Rule 3.28 of the Listing Rules and is capable of discharging the
functions of a company secretary, so that a further waiver will not be necessary.

**WAIVER AND EXEMPTION IN RELATION TO THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLANS**
**DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS**

Rule 17.02(1)(b) of the Listing Rules requires a [REDACTED] to, inter alia, disclose in
the document full details of all outstanding options and awards and their potential dilution
effect on the shareholdings upon [REDACTED] as well as the impact on the earnings per share
arising from the issue of shares in respect of such outstanding options or awards. Pursuant to
paragraphs 6 to 7 of Chapter 3.6 of the Guide for New Listing Applicants, the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange would normally grant waivers from disclosing the names and addresses of
certain grantees if the [REDACTED] could demonstrate that such disclosures would be
irrelevant or unduly burdensome, subject to certain conditions specified therein.

As of the Latest Practicable Date, our Company had granted outstanding restricted Shares
respectively under the Restricted Share Incentive Plans to 138 grantees (the “Grantees”),
entitling them to subscribe for 3,011,850 A Shares, representing approximately [REDACTED]
of the total number of Shares in issue immediately after completion of the [REDACTED]
(assuming the [REDACTED] is not exercised, no new Shares are issued under the Restricted
Share Incentive Plans and no other changes are made to the issued share capital of the
Company between the Latest Practicable Date and the [REDACTED], respectively). Among
the outstanding restricted Shares, one Director and 137 Grantees (who are employees of our
Group and are not Directors, members of senior management, consultants or connected persons
of our Company) were granted restricted Shares for 54,000 A Shares and 2,957,850 A Shares,
respectively. Save for the aforementioned, no restricted Shares were granted to any Director,
member of senior management, connected person or consultant of our Company. No restricted
Shares under the Restricted Share Incentive Plans will be further granted after the

[REDACTED] and all restricted Shares have been granted to specific individuals under the
Restricted Share Incentive Plans.

We have applied to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for a waiver from strict compliance
with the requirements under Rule 17.02(1)(b) in connection with the disclosure of certain
details relating to the Restricted Share Incentive Plans and the Grantees in this document on
the ground that the waiver will not prejudice the interest of [REDACTED] and full compliance
with such disclosure requirements would be unduly burdensome for our Company for the
following reasons:

(a) given that 138 Grantees are involved in the grant of outstanding restricted Shares
under the Restricted Share Incentive Plans, our Directors consider that it would be
unduly burdensome to disclose in this document full details of all the restricted
Shares granted by us to each of the Grantees, which would significantly increase the


-----

cost and time required for information compilation and document preparation for
strict compliance with such disclosure requirements as the Company would need to
collect and verify the addresses of a large number of the Grantees to meet the
disclosure requirement;

(b) the disclosure of the personal details of each Grantee, including their names,
addresses for the Grantees and the number of restricted Shares granted, may require
obtaining consent from all the Grantees in order to comply with personal data
privacy laws and principles and it would be unduly burdensome for our Company to
obtain such consents given the number of the Grantees;

(c) the grant and vesting in full of the restricted Shares under the Restricted Share
Incentive Plans will not cause any material adverse impact to the financial position
of our Group;

(d) there will not be any new H Shares issued under the Restricted Share Incentive Plans
as the foregoing plans are A-share incentive schemes;

(e) our Directors consider that non-compliance with the above disclosure requirements
would not prevent our Company from providing potential [REDACTED] with
sufficient information for an informed assessment of the activities, assets, liabilities,
financial position, management and prospects of our Group;

(f) full disclosure of details of the Grantees (which include their names and addresses),
as well as the restricted Shares granted to each of them, would provide the Group’s
competitors with the Group’s employees’ compensation details and facilitate their
soliciting activities which may impact the Group’s ability to recruit and retain
valuable personnel;

(g) material information on the restricted Shares under the Restricted Share Incentive
Plans have been disclosed in “Appendix IV — Statutory and General Information —
Restricted Share Incentive Plans” to provide prospective [REDACTED] with
sufficient information to make an informed assessment of the potential dilutive
effect and impact on earnings per Share of the restricted Shares in making their

[REDACTED] decision, and such information includes: (1) a summary of the terms
of the Restricted Share Incentive Plans; (2) the aggregate number of A Shares
subject to the outstanding restricted Shares; (3) and the percentage in our total
issued Shares of which such number represents; (4) the details of the outstanding
restricted Shares granted under the Restricted Share Incentive Plans by the range of
underlying A Shares, including date of grant, vesting period, purchase price and the
percentage of our Company’s total issued share capital represented upon completion
of the [REDACTED].


-----

In light of the above, our Directors believe that the grant of the waiver sought under this
application and the non-disclosure of the required information will not hinder potential

[REDACTED] from making an informed assessment of the activities, assets and liabilities,
financial position, management and prospects of our Group and will not prejudice the interest
of the public [REDACTED].

The Stock Exchange [has granted] to us a waiver from strict compliance with the
disclosure requirements under Rule 17.02(1)(b) of the Listing Rules with respect to the
restricted Shares granted under the Restricted Share Incentive Plans, subject to the conditions
that:

(a) on an individual basis, full details of the outstanding restricted Shares granted by the
Company under the Restricted Share Incentive Plans to each of the Directors,
members of the senior management, consultants and connected persons of the
Company, will be disclosed in the section headed “Appendix IV — Statutory and
General Information — D. Our Incentive Plans” as required under Rule 17.02(1)(b)
of, and paragraph 27 of Appendix D1A to, the Listing Rules, and paragraph 10 of
Part 1 of the Third Schedule to the CWUMPO;

(b) in respect of the restricted Shares granted by our Company under the Restricted
Share Incentive Plans to the remaining Grantees other than those referred to in
subparagraph above (the “Other Grantee(s)”), the following details will be
disclosed in the section headed “Appendix IV — Statutory and General Information
— D. Our Incentive Plans”, on an aggregate basis, (i) the number of the Other
Grantees and the number of A Shares underlying the restricted Shares, (ii) date of
grant, the vesting period, and purchase price of the restricted Shares granted, and
(iii) the percentage of our Company’s total issued share capital represented by such
restricted Shares upon completion of the [REDACTED] (assuming the

[REDACTED] is not exercised, no further Shares are issued under the Restricted
Share Incentive Plans, and no other changes are made to the issued share capital of
our Company between the Latest Practicable Date and the [REDACTED]);

(c) the aggregate number of A Shares underlying the outstanding restricted Shares and
the percentage of our Company’s total issued share capital represented by such
number of A Shares as of the Latest Practicable Date will be disclosed in the section
headed “Appendix IV — Statutory and General Information — D. Our Incentive
Plans”;

(d) a summary of the principal terms of the Restricted Share Incentive Plans will be
disclosed in the section headed “Appendix IV — Statutory and General Information
— D. Our Incentive Plans” in this document; and

(e) the particulars of this waiver are set out in this document; and a full list of all the
Grantees with outstanding restricted Shares for A Shares under the Restricted Share
Incentive Plans, containing all details as required under Rule 17.02(1)(b) the Listing
Rules be made available for public inspection in accordance with “Documents
Delivered to the Registrar of Companies in Hong Kong and Available on Display —
Document Available for Inspection” in Appendix V to this document.
