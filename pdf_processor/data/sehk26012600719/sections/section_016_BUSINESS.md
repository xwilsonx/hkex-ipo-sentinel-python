**_Memory module supporting chips_**

We have adopted a co-development model that enables us to serve as a core supplier to
major global memory companies, in particular, top-tier DRAM module players in the world.
The AI-era is driving substantial upgrades in memory configurations for servers and PCs used
in AI infrastructure. Mainstream AI servers typically deploy more than 20 DDR5 memory
modules — about twice that of general-purpose servers. The increasing adoption of AI PCs is
also driving successive upgrades in memory configurations for our customers. We have
developed SPD chips for memory modules since DDR2. For DDR5, building on our
mass-production track record and core technologies, we have established an in-depth
partnership with a global leader in memory interconnect chips. As DDR5 spreads across data
centers and edge computing, we believe our SPD chip technology will continue to be
recognized by enterprises specializing in memory modules and provide technological
underpinnings for secure and controllable digital infrastructure in China and globally.

We supply the essential SPD chips for our strategic partner’s DDR5 memory interface
solutions, which are critical components used in DRAM modules in servers. Therefore, we
benefit from this synergistic collaboration in terms of expedited product roll-out and quickly
access the world’s major DRAM module suppliers. The global server DRAM market is highly
concentrated, with top-tier players capturing the vast majority of market share, a landscape that
enables us to capitalize on the market’s rapid growth. According to Frost & Sullivan, the global
top three DRAM suppliers together accounted for over 90% of the server DRAM market in
2024 and we are the world’s second largest supplier of DDR5 SPD chips in 2023 and 2024 by
revenue.

We are also actively extending our product lines and have introduced VPD chips
supporting next-generation high-performance memory devices. VPD has become a key
component in new-generation enterprise SSD (eSSD) modules and CXL (Compute Express
Link) memory expansion modules, where it provides vital parameter management, device
identification, and system-level verification. As model training and inference scale up, AI
servers and high-performance computing systems demand more of memory performance,
reliability, and manageability. Standards for eSSD and CXL are advancing accordingly,
imposing tighter requirements on VPD accuracy, stability, and interface capability. In VPD, we
have partnered with a globally leading memory manufacturer that leads standard setting and
product specifications, becoming the first VPD developer to enter the design-in phase to
support that company’s next-generation eSSD modules and CXL memory expansion modules,
thereby establishing a first-mover advantage and building technical and customer barriers.

-----

-  _Memory module supporting chips, which primarily include SPD chips installed on_
_DDR (double data rate) DRAM modules used in PCs and servers. SPD chips are our_
primary product offering in this category, which store the module’s identity and
timing parameters and, in DDR5, also mediate I[2]C and I[3]C and sense temperature.
In addition, we are developing VPD chips intended to provide module identity and
configuration memory for next-generation enterprise SSDs, extending our modulemanagement know-how from DRAM modules into enterprise memory.

-  _High-reliability memory chips for automotive electronics and industrial control,_
_which comprise automotive-grade and industrial-grade memory chips. This segment_
has far stricter requirements for reliability, temperature tolerance, and certification
(such as AEC-Q100, IATF 16949) than consumer-grade products, forming high
entry barriers. We are the only China-based supplier offering a full spectrum,
series-grade automotive-grade EEPROM portfolio as of the end of 2025. These
efforts have built solid competitive barriers. We serve 16 of the world’s top 20 car
brands, and the relatively long automotive certification cycle creates strong
customer stickiness for our memory chips for automative electronics and industrial
control.

-  _Memory chips for consumer electronics. Compared to automotive and industrial-_
grade products, the certification requirements of memory chips for consumer
electronics prioritize ultra-low power consumption and compact size. Our memory
chips for this segment serve broader applications (smartphones, handheld gimbal,
wearables, home appliances) with reliability calibrated to typical consumer product
life cycles.

**_Memory module supporting chips_**

We design and supply SPD chips that provide the identity, configuration memory,
management channel and thermal telemetry required across DDR generations from DDR2
through DDR5, currently with a primary focus on DDR5. Every DDR module carries an SPD
chip, which embeds a non-volatile SPD that stores the module’s identity and timing parameters
so the system can bring the memory up correctly at power-on and operate it at rated
performance. In DDR5, the SPD also integrates an I[2]C/I[3]C hub that mediates the Sideband Bus
among on-module devices and a high-precision temperature sensor at the SPD. JEDEC
standards require a PMIC on DDR5 modules to manage local power delivery, and our SPD
interoperate with the PMIC and TS over the management channel to support standardscompliant configuration and thermal control.

We have built this product line generation by generation. During the DDR2 and DDR3
eras, we established a complete SPD portfolio across mainstream module types, through which
we built relationships with major module makers. In the first half of 2022, we leveraged a
market-wide DDR4 SPD supply shortage to broaden our presence with leading module
manufacturers. Our initiatives in this period reinforced our reputation for reliable delivery and
fast platform adaptation of our SPD chip products.


-----

The transition to DDR5 marked a step-change in both specification and market
opportunity. We launched DDR5 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Since then, our co-developed
DDR5 SPD chips have moved into broad deployment at major memory module players. We had
established an in-depth partnership with Montage, a global leader in memory interconnect
chips. We hold a leading market position in DDR5 SPD. We are the second largest supplier of
DDR5 SPD chips in the world in 2023 and 2024 by revenue, according to Frost & Sullivan.

Our products’ form factor and platform coverage has expanded in line with market
demand. Our DDR5 SPD is not only applied on memory module formats used in desktops,
laptops, and servers, including UDIMMs, SODIMMs, and RDIMMs, but also supports new
slim-form-factor memory module packaging formats, such as CAMM/CAMM2 and
LPCAMM/LPCAMM2. These memory modules require one SPD and one PMIC per module.
As premium thin-and-light laptops and other electronics products gradually shift from the older
LPDDR to LPCAMM2, the demand for our DDR5 SPD chips increases. In addition, our DDR5
SPD covers memory module packaging formats, such as RDIMM, LRDIMM, MRDIMM and
SOCAMM/SOCAMM2. A typical DDR5 server DIMM carries one SPD, two TS and one PMIC
under the JEDEC standard. AI servers commonly use over 20 DIMMs per system, roughly
twice as many as for a mainstream general-purpose server. This multiplies the number of units
needed for our SPD chips, creating a significant need for our DDR5 SPD chips.

Our strong technology and standards compliance underpin this product line. We design
our SPD hub for the JEDEC-defined I[2]C and I[3]C management channel used on DDR5 DIMMs.
This allows system controllers to discover and configure on-module devices, read vital product
data, and monitor thermal conditions with high reliability. The embedded non-volatile SPD
keeps identity and configuration data even when power is off for the entire life of the module.
The integrated TS provides continuous readings at the SPD location to support thermal
management and performance derating policies.

In 2023, we began developing a VPD chip which is the first VPD chip to enter the
design-in phase to support next-generation eSSD modules and CXL memory expansion
modules, extending our module-management expertise beyond DRAM and aligning with the
industry’s move toward standardized non-volatile identity in enterprise memory storage.

_Key features and application scenarios of memory module supporting chips_

Our DDR5 SPD integrates three functional blocks, an 8 Kb EEPROM for identity and
configuration, an I[2]C/I[3]C hub that complies with the JEDEC-defined I[2]C/I[3]C management
channel on DDR5 DIMMs, and a high-precision temperature sensor located at the SPD site for
local thermal telemetry. Our DDR5 SPD is in mass production and can be applied across
UDIMM, SODIMM, CAMM/CAMM2, LPCAMM/LPCAMM2, SOCAMM/SOCAMM2,
RDIMM, LRDIMM and MRDIMM. We co-developed our DDR5 SPD with Montage and
established broad deployment by major memory module players beginning late 2021. As
compared with DDR4 SPD, our DDR5 SPD contains higher specifications and richer
on-module content, increasing the value of our DDR5 SPD per module. In addition, a wider
application of AI servers and AI PCs further increases demand for our DDR5 SPD chips.


-----

The application scenarios of our memory module supporting chips include, without
limitation:

-  _PCs. DDR5 SPD is applied on UDIMM and SODIMM for desktops and notebooks and_
on the new thin-and-light formats CAMM/CAMM2 and LPCAMM/LPCAMM2,
which are gaining adoption in new notebooks and compact designs. As the industry
moves toward AI PCs, memory modules in these systems tend to carry more memory
chips creating more opportunities for us.

-  _Data centers, servers, and AI servers. In data centers, DDR5 SPD handles_
identification and management-bus communications across RDIMM, LRDIMM,
MRDIMM formats and also supports SOCAMM/SOCAMM2 formats for
accelerator-class and AI-server designs. AI servers typically use more than twenty
DDR5 DIMMs in a single system, about twice as many as mainstream generalpurpose servers. As AI servers adopt more DDR5 DIMMs, the need for our DDR5
SPD is expected to grow compared with DDR4. In addition, the next-generation
GPU solution from one of the world’s largest GPU suppliers will adopt the
SOCAMM2 memory module form factor, and this solution also relies on DDR5 SPD
chips to complete memory parameter configuration.

-  _Enterprise SSDs. In 2023, we began developing a VPD chip that brings identity and_
configuration functions to next-generation eSSD modules and CXL memory
expansion modules. A VPD chip enables consistent identity, field updates, and
fleet-wide management across SSDs.

-  _Legacy and embedded systems. Our DDR3 and DDR4 SPD chips remain available_
for long-lifecycle platforms in industrial, embedded, and specialty computing.

Across these application scenarios, our SPD chip’s embedded non-volatile EEPROM
stores identity and configuration data even when power is off. Its integrated hub supports
standards-compliant I[2]C/I[3]C communications among on-module devices, and its temperature
sensing helps systems manage performance and stability under heavy load. In DDR5, our SPD
chip works smoothly with on-module PMICs and temperature sensors in line with JEDEC’s
module topology, which enables reliable system bring-up, telemetry, and thermal management
in PCs, servers, and AI platforms.

**_High-reliability memory chips for automotive electronics and industrial control_**

We design and supply high-reliability non-volatile memory chips for demanding
embedded systems in vehicles and in industrial control equipment. Our portfolio centers on
EEPROM for small, frequently updated parameters, identifiers, and logs. Our portfolio also
includes NOR Flash for executable code and larger configuration blocks that must be read
quickly and predictably. These chips are built for long service life, strong data integrity, and
stable operation under electrical noise, voltage swings, and frequent power cycling.


-----

_(i)_ _Automotive electronics_

Our automotive-grade EEPROM spans the A1-A2 series and covers densities from about
1 Kb to 4 Mb. Our automotive-grade EEPROM support I[2]C, SPI, and Microwire interfaces and
offer compact packages to accommodate space-constrained control boards of a smart vehicle.
We also offer automotive-grade NOR Flash focused on low to mid densities, centered around
the 512 Kb to 16 Mb range, to host safety-critical and performance-sensitive code. The design,
screening, and reliability testing processes of our automotive memory chips adhere to
established automotive industry standards and have completed AEC-Q100 validation.

We have progressed through successive design wins and process improvements. We have
introduced the A1-A2 automotive EEPROM and expanded densities and interfaces of our
memory chip products for this segment over multiple generations. We also improved write
endurance and data retention to meet vehicle lifetime targets. By 2023, our selected EEPROM
achieved AEC-Q100 validation and entered series production with Tier-1 suppliers.

In 2024, we introduced low-density automotive NOR Flash, which can be applied in
automotive cockpit and body. In addition, we have made our automotive NOR Flash, mainly
for use in ADAS systems and power electronics.

_(ii)_ _Industrial control_

For industrial control markets, our EEPROM products span roughly 1 Kb to 4 Mb and our
NOR Flash products span 512 Kb to 64 Mb, with higher densities expected to be introduced
in the future to support growing firmware images in automation, energy, and communications.

We develop this product line to gain broad adoption in factory automation and
communications equipment. Through 2024 and 2025, we taped out and sampled higher-density
industrial NOR Flash at 64 Mb, with additional densities under development for larger
over-the-air updatable firmware in automation, digital energy, and networking.

_Key features and application scenarios of high-reliability memory chips for automotive_
_electronics and industrial control_

We design our high-reliability memory chips for automotive electronics and industrial
control with long service life and ability to provide steady performance under harsh
environments. They are built to keep data intact, tolerate noise and power swings, and fit into
dense circuit boards and modules.

_EEPROM. We target multi-million write cycles at room temperature with controlled_
derating at higher temperatures. Our EEPROM products for automotive electronics and
industrial control offer long data retention, low standby current, and compact packages, and
also offer interface options covering I[2]C, SPI, and Microwire, with common voltage and


-----

pin-count variants to make replacement and design-in straightforward. Our automotive-grade
EEPROM spans the A1-A2 series and continues to gain acceptance of customers across their
automative cockpit, visual perception, body, and powertrain programs.

_NOR Flash. Our NOR Flash products can realize 100,000 erasure/programming cycles_
and nominal data retention over a 20-year period at room temperature. Read performance of
our NOR Flash supports fast random access and execute-in-place, meaning code can run
directly from flash. Our NOR Flash is also hardened for ESD and latch-up to handle noisy
environments.

Across these memory chip products, we continue to refine our technology to reduce
quiescent power, and improve electromagnetic and electrical robustness to meet evolving
automotive and industrial standards.

The application scenarios of our memory chips for automotive electronics and industrial
control include, without limitation:

-  _Cockpit systems. Our high-reliability memory chips for automotive electronics and_
industrial control store configuration, calibration, logs, and code across major
electronic domains in a smart vehicle. In the intelligent cockpit, instrument clusters,
infotainment head units, and head-up displays use our EEPROM to retain trim data,
feature flags, and event logs through repeated updates and power cycles.

-  _ADAS and vision sensing. Camera modules, millimeter-wave radar modules and_
laser lidar modules use our EEPROM for lens and sensor calibration, module IDs,
and diagnostics that must stay accurate for the life of the vehicle. With sensor counts
and data rates keep increasing in a smart vehicle, durable parameter storage and
quick code execution of our EEPROM become more critical to the steady
performance of these modules.

-  _Body and chassis systems. Body control modules, electric power steering, and_
integrated braking systems write and rewrite parameters, status, and fault logs
throughout their service life. Our EEPROM supports these frequent updates with
high write endurance and noise immunity to protect data during cranking,
brownouts, and load dumps.

-  _Electrified powertrain. Battery management systems, traction inverters, onboard_
chargers, and auxiliary controllers combine EEPROM for configuration and
diagnostics. These applications emphasize long retention, resistance to
electromagnetic interference, and dependable behavior under sustained thermal
stress. Our memory chip products meet these needs across OEM qualification flows
and extended service horizons.


-----

-  _Industrial automation. Our EEPROM powers programmable logic controllers, servo_
drives, robotics, and factory gateways. Engineers store IDs, calibration constants,
and field logs in EEPROM that must tolerate frequent updates and sudden power
loss. Human-machine interface panels use EEPROM in display and touch modules
to deliver responsive user interfaces and safe, repeatable firmware updates over
many years.

-  _Digital energy and power electronics. In photovoltaic inverters, energy-storage_
systems, DC/DC and AC/DC converters, and EV charging equipment, our EEPROM
records configuration and fault or event logs that survive brownouts, service cycles,
and grid disturbances. As these platforms add richer telemetry and remote
management, demand grows for larger code storage and more frequent parameter
updates.

-  _Communications infrastructure and optical modules. Our EEPROM stores module_
identifiers, digital diagnostics, and calibration data that host systems read for
monitoring and control. Optical transceivers and access or aggregation equipment
require compact footprints, low power, and predictable long-term retention, and we
tailor our memory chip products for dense, thermally constrained line cards and
modules.

-  _Medical devices and instruments. Manufacturers use our EEPROM to retain_
calibration, device identifiers, and maintenance histories across regulated lifetimes
of their end-products. These end-products run under controlled but extended
temperature ranges and duty cycles, so we focus on data integrity and read stability
to support long product lifecycles of these end-products.

**_Memory chips for consumer electronics_**

We serve consumer electronics end-products with a broad portfolio of non-volatile
memory chips tailored for compact form factors and tight power budgets typically required of
consumer electronics end-products. In these systems, our EEPROM stores small, frequently
updated parameters such as calibration data, device identifiers, pairing keys and production
records, and it preserves those data without power across the use life of particular consumer
electronics end-products. We offer EEPROM from approximately 1 Kb to 4 Mb across I[2]C, SPI
and Microwire interfaces, and low-power SPI NOR Flash from 512 Kb to 64 Mb for consumer
applications. We also offer SPI NOR Flash with higher-density reserves on ETOX with tens and
hundreds of megabits to support larger firmware of certain consumer electronics end-products.

We established an early leadership position in smartphone imaging through entering the
camera module of a top-tier mobile phone supplier in 2011. By 2016, we have become a top
supplier of smartphone EEPROM for that use. As consumer electronics end-products demand
lower power, we introduced an ultra-low-voltage smartphone EEPROM in January 2022
operating at 1.2 V and supporting automatic interface-voltage recognition for 1.2 V and 1.8 V
I[2]C rails, and it was selected as the sole EEPROM for the reference design of a leading smart
phone brand. That design win accelerated the adoption of our memory chip products across
power-sensitive wearables and emerging AI glasses.


-----

_EEPROM chips used in smart phones_

By 2024, we ranked among the top global EEPROM suppliers by market share and held
leading positions in smartphone cameras, LCD/AMOLED panels and Bluetooth modules. In
2025, we continued to improve our memory chip products to address package miniaturization
requirements of certain consumer electronics end-products. In addition, we are developing
higher-density SPI NOR Flash on ETOX to address larger over-the-air updatable firmware
images in displays and connected accessories of certain consumer electronics end-products.

_Key features and application scenarios of memory chips for consumer electronics_

_EEPROM. Our consumer EEPROM memory chips target multi-million write cycles at_
room temperature with controlled derating at higher temperatures. They offer long data
retention, low standby current, and broad interface support across I[2]C, SPI, and Microwire. Our
memory chip products offer ultra-low-voltage options down to about 1.2 V, with automatic
interface-voltage adoptation between 1.2 V and 1.8 V for I[2]C, fitting the power budgets of
smartphones, handheld gimbals, wearables, and AI glasses. Our consumer EEPROM also offer
package choices, primarily small-footprint WLCSP.

_NOR Flash. Our consumer NOR Flash memory chips focus on low-power SPI NOR from_
512 Kb to 64 Mb. They deliver fast random reads for execute-in-place firmware, strong ESD
and latch-up robustness, and extended nominal retention.

Commercially, our consumer memory chips are in mass production across smartphones,
displays, connectivity modules, comprising a wide range of consumer electronics. Our
consumer memory chips have gained adoption in wearables, handheld gimbals and AI-adjacent
devices. We continue to enhance penetration of our consumer memory chips through new
design wins in AI-enabled consumer electronics end-products and to grow share in established
markets, such as LCD and AMOLED panels and connectivity modules, solidifying our position
as a leading supplier of consumer-grade non-volatile memory chips.


-----

**_Lens driver chips_**

We have built this product line step by step and moved up the value chain. Our earlystage open-loop driver chips delivered fast autofocus in compact packages and helped establish
our brand. Several series of our open-loop lens driver chips were included in municipal
innovation catalogs in 2019 and 2023, underscoring our technology advantages in this product
line. In 2023, we introduced a new generation of open-loop driver chips that features automatic
interface-voltage adoptation between 1.2 V and 1.8 V, with self-adaptive capabilities to
accommodate different voltage requirements of end-products. With this product type reaching
mass production, our lens driver chips have received wide customer acceptance and recorded
robust growth. In parallel, we advanced development of closed-loop and OIS driver chips by
solving key challenges in closed-loop control, high-precision ADC design, and gyro-assisted
stabilization algorithm. After passing platform validation, we have began deliveries of
closed-loop and OIS driver chips to leading smartphone OEMs.

During 2024, we started producing additional variants of open-loop lens driver chips,
including driver chip-plus-EEPROM combinations, and expanded validations and pilot
shipments for closed-loop and OIS driver chips into mid- to high-end models. In 2025, we
began shipping multiple OIS driver chips to major smartphone brands, showcasing our ability
to develop and deliver lens driver chips in the highest value tier of this segment. We plan to
focus on broadening the penetration of our OIS driver chips, compressing stabilization time
even further, optimizing the gyro-assisted stabilization algorithm, and continuing to reduce
chip size and power so the parts can fit thinner camera modules and higher-end periscope
modules. We will also continue to extend driver chip-plus-memory integration to meaningfully
lower module size and make calibration simpler.

_Key features and application scenarios of lens driver chips_

Our open-loop lens driver chips use damping-aware algorithms, lens-parameter selfdetection, and offset-current self-calibration to achieve fast-settling control. They deliver quick
autofocus, minimizing module size and allowing large motor tolerance. Certain types of our
open-loop lens driver chips also enable automatic interface-voltage adoptation between 1.2 V
and 1.8 V to accommodate different voltage requirements of end-products.

Our closed-loop drivers chips contain precise sensing and tighter control to improve
accuracy and keep performance of the end-products, such as smartphones and cameras, steady
across temperature and power changes. Our closed-loop driver chips are moving from customer
testing into wider use. Our OIS driver chips together with gyro-assisted stabilization are now
applied in mid- to high-end smartphones. We expect adoption of our lens driver chips to keep
growing as premium camera modules make multi-axis stabilization standard.

We focus our lens driver chips on enabling fast lens stabilization that settles in a fraction
of one actuator cycle and broader tolerance to actuator variation, such that our customers can
source lenses from multiple suppliers. We also offer built-in memory options that integrate
with our lens driver chips, such as EEPROM or on-chip NOR Flash, to store calibration and
control parameters locally. We strive to enhance performance, stability, and energy efficiency
of our lens driver chips while keeping their sizes small for thin camera stacks and other
space-constrained modules. With the wider acceptance of lens-embedded mobile and connected
consumer electronics end-products, we believe the penetration of our lens driver chips will
continue to grow.

_A pictorial illustration of the assembly structure of a lens driver chip_

The application scenarios include, without limitation:

-  _Smartphones. Our lens driver chips power autofocus and stabilization in rear and_
front camera modules, improving focus speed, stability, and image sharpness from
mainstream to flagship phones. Our open-loop driver chips are used in high-volume
autofocus channels where fast settling and low cost matter the most. They choose
closed-loop driver chips for channels that require faster settling and higher-precision
focus control. They adopt OIS drivers in mid- to high-end modules to reduce blur
in photos and video caused by shaking. As multi-camera arrays spread and front
cameras add autofocus, the number of lens per smartphone increases and therefore,
the demand for our lens driver chips is expected to rise, too. We also offer driver
chips-plus-EEPROM options to shrink module size and simplify parts count.

-  _Handheld gimbal. Lens driver chips provide precise attitude control and image_
stabilization functions. From entry-level smartphone gimbals to professional camera
gimbals, they enhance footage smoothness, response speed, and shooting stability.
Applications for consumer-grade lightweight gimbals prioritize low power
consumption, quiet operation, and cost-effectiveness. With the growing popularity
of short-form videos and video blogs, handheld gimbals require higher motor torque
and response precision, which is expected to drive up the demand for lens driver
chips.

-  _Other compact imaging devices. Manufacturers require the same control and_
stabilization of lens in video-conference terminals, access-control and intercom
cameras, and scanner or imaging modules in retail and logistics settings. These
end-products value fast settling, low noise, and stable long-term lens performance
in tight, thermally constrained surroundings. We optimize our algorithms to achieve
stabilization in less than one actuator cycle and maintain tolerance to driver
frequency variation, enabling compatibility with multiple lens driver chips with only
minor adjustments to chip parameter settings. In tablets and consumer cameras, our
closed-loop and OIS driver chips enable sharper images in low light and during
motion for casual photography and content creation.


-----

-  _Wearables and smart-home imaging. Space and power are especially limited in_
wearables and smart-home imaging devices. We emphasize small packages, low
quiescent power, and driver chip-plus-memory integration to preserve space for
optics while keeping autofocus fast and repeatable. We work with module makers to
co-optimize the mechanical stack and control targets so focus and stabilization settle
quickly within ultra-thin assemblies.

**Other products**

Beyond memory chips and lens driver chips, we apply our non-volatile memory and
mixed-signal expertise to identification and contactless communication. Our primary product
in this category is the NFC chip.

**_NFC chips_**

Our NFC chips are built for broad interoperability and practical security. They follow the
chip specifications made by the NFC Forum and common ISO/IEC proximity standards, so
they work seamlessly with smartphones and mass-market IC readers. They combine a sensitive
RF front end that saves energy and keeps the connectivity stable with an anti-collision
mechanism, such that multiple e-tags can be read without interference. Embedded non-volatile
memory of our NFC ships stores fixed identifiers and application data that our customers can
update in the field for provisioning, feature enablement, and after-sales support, with
safeguards such as password protection, lock bits, and optional authentication. Our NFC chips
are tuned for low power so they read reliably at longer distances for a given antenna size, and
they deliver consistent performance across manufacturing and environmental variation to
ensure predictable behavior in large deployment. Across the portfolio we strive to reduce die
area, improve RF sensitivity, streamline memory organization for faster reads and writes, and
expand packaging options to simplify integration into space-constrained products and labels.

The application scenarios include, without limitation:

-  _Electronic price tags. Our NFC chips are integrated into electronic price tags,_
supporting rapid device initialization, battery-free E-ink refreshing, and interactive
consumer marketing. Built-in memory stores SKU identifiers, configuration
parameters, and dynamic promotional links, ensuring real-time retail data and
traceability. Our NFC chips ensure fast and stable read or write performance, even
in high-density environments.

-  _Consumer electronics and smart-home devices. Manufacturers embed our NFC chips_
to enable tap-to-pair and tap-to-configure experiences. An end-user brings a
smartphone near a speaker, headset, TV, set-top box, or home-automation node to
complete secure pairing, provision Wi-Fi credentials, or start a guided setup. The
NFC chip embedded in the e-tag stores configuration data, device identifiers, and
service links that persist without power and can be updated in subsequent
installation or maintenance.

**RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT**

As of September 30, 2025, we had a total of 203 full time employees engaged in research
and development. In 2023 and 2024 and in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our
research and development expenses amounted to RMB160.8 million, RMB175.6 million and
RMB146.5 million, respectively.

Our research and development programs focus on the development of our core NVM and
mixed-signal technologies. Our R&D teams cover circuit design, analog and mixed-signal,
firmware and algorithms, product engineering, reliability, and applications support.

Our first priority in our R&D efforts is to solidify our position in SPD chips in DDR5
modules. Our DDR5 SPD combines EEPROM, an I[2]C/I[3]C hub, and a temperature sensor, and
we also supply stand-alone temperature sensors used on many server DIMMs. We continue to
apply our SPD chips to more form factors for computer memory modules, distinguished
primarily by their physical size and application, such as UDIMM, SODIMM, CAMM/CAMM2,
LPCAMM/LPCAMM2, SOCAMM/SOCAMM2, RDIMM, LRDIMM, and MRDIMM.

For EEPROM, we are developing smaller-die, higher-reliability devices for industrial and
automotive use, with automotive-grade series spanning A1-A2. For NOR Flash, we focus on
low-power parts at low to mid densities. Our NOR Flash from 512 Kb to 32 Mb are in mass
production, 64 Mb and 128 Mb parts have taped out, and higher densities are under
development. Selected low-density devices have achieved program/erase cycles of 100,000 and
retention over a 20-year period at room temperature, and portions of the 512 Kb-16 Mb series
have completed AEC-Q100 validation.

In addition, we are moving our lens driver portfolio into higher-value segments. We
continue to improve our open-loop driver chips used in high-volume camera modules. We have
progressed through validation and into deployments our closed-loop driver chips integrated
with high-precision sensing. In 2025, multiple OIS driver chips began commercial shipments
on mid- to high-end smartphones.

Furthermore, we continually upgrade our NFC products. We are reducing die area,
improving read/write speed and RF sensitivity, and expanding toward higher-value CPU cards
and a broader range of RFID/NFC offerings, such as public transport, access control and
identity, campus cards, smart metering, electronic price tag, new retail and supply-chain
management, while maintaining compliance with ISO/IEC 14443 and 15693 and support for
standard cryptographic algorithms.

Notably, in 2023, we began developing a VPD chip for new-generation enterprise SSDs
and CXL memory expansion modules to extend our module-management know-how beyond
DRAM modules.

**INVENTORY MANAGEMENT**

We regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record provisions for excess and
obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our forecast of future demand
for our products. In setting our inventory turnover targets, we also consider the public-relations
environment, political developments, macroeconomic trends, and end-market conditions. We
attempt to control our inventory levels so that we do not hold inventories in excess of demand
at the end of each fiscal quarter.

Our inventory turnover days were 252 days, 226 days and 245 days in 2023 and 2024 and
the nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. To improve our inventory efficiency,
we have adopted a unified warehousing and distribution system and continuously enhance
inventory turnover. We have developed strong capabilities in regard to order execution, global
supply chain management and efficient delivery. We run an integrated sales and operations
planning process that aligns sales and manufacturing through rolling forecasts and clear rules
for converting demand into firm production and purchasing plans.

We have adopted business-to-business electronic data exchanges that enables us to
manage our inventory and facilitate our order requests to our suppliers. Our suppliers are
provided with improved demand planning through analyzes of transaction activities, which
allows us to make reasonable forecasts and maintain efficient manufacturing or procurement
processes. With the collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment model, visualization
of orders, and other features, we can improve the execution and delivery efficiency of product
orders at a much lower cost, better positioning us to maintain an optimal inventory level to
satisfy market demand in a timely manner.


-----

**SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT**

We established a comprehensive supply chain management system covering supplier
onboarding, approval, and other processes, and we strive to continuously refine the system. At
the stage of supplier onboarding, we conduct preliminary examination of suppliers. Thereafter,
new suppliers are also required to go through quality system survey, on-site audit and sign the
quality agreement. They are included in our list of qualified suppliers after the review and
approval by the production management department, quality department and other
departments.

We have developed and continue to optimize our supplier quality management
procedures. We conduct audits of suppliers at fixed frequencies and take supplier management
actions such as regular evaluations and quarterly quality meetings to continuously improve the
quality management level of suppliers. We conduct quarterly evaluations for qualified
suppliers on quality assurance, process and technology, production capacity, lead time and
services, price, environmental protection, etc. In addition, we formulate an annual audit plan
every year and conduct comprehensive and in-depth onsite audits of suppliers. Suppliers who
did not receive satisfactory results in the audit are required to develop an improvement plan
based on the audit results and implement it within the given time frame. Additionally, we also
dispatch staff to conduct on-site inspections, supervising suppliers’ production processes,
quality control systems, and environmental protection measures. All records of supply audits
and matters for rectification are entered into a supply management system and will be followed
up until they are closed, forming a closed-loop management, to ensure the efficient and stable
operation of our supply chain.

-----

During the Track Record Period, we did not have any material dispute with the terminated
distributors. There is typically no minimum purchase amount requirements. Some of the
distribution agreements we enter into include arrangements for price adjustment mechanism,
which is determined based on a mix of factors, such as (i) the number of products the
distributor orders, and (ii) the prior established business relationship between the Company and
the distributor.

**_Measures to avoid channel stuffing_**

We have set up and implemented multiple measures to ensure the benefits of our
distributors by avoiding channel stuffing, including:

-  _Buyer-seller relationship. We and our distributors are in a buyer-seller relationship._
We typically do not accept product returns subject to limited exceptions, ensuring
that distributors will not compel us to accept unsold products. We regularly monitor
the level of product returns from the distributors. During the Track Record Period,
the amount of returns accounted for less than 1% of our total sales to distributors.

-  _No minimum procurement target. We typically do not set up minimum procurement_
target for our distributors as to avoid overload of products with our distributors.

-  _Monthly report. We monitor and manage our distributors through a reporting_
mechanism, under which our distributors are required to provide a monthly report of
their sales, including sales volume and product categories.

**_Measures to avoid cannibalization_**

We have implemented anti-cannibalization measures. Our international distributors are
restricted to distribute in designated territories. For distributions in the Greater China region,
we divide the sales scope into Northern China and Southern China, based on the location of our
subsidiaries. We conduct regular review of distributors’ sales reports to monitor the pricing at
which they sold our products. Through these measures, we are able to coordinate and monitor
our distributors’ sales. We believe these measures are effective in mitigating the risk of
cannibalization and in maintaining the efficiency of our distribution channels.

**_Key terms of distribution agreements for our products_**

Set forth below is a summary of the key terms of the agreements with our distributors:

-  _Term. We generally enter into a master distribution agreement with a term of one_
year, automatically renewable every year unless earlier terminated by either party
(typically with 30 days prior notice).


-----

-  _Pricing. We typically sell products to our distributors at our fixed prices in effect at_
the time of shipment. The fixed price we set with a distributor is determined based
on a mix of factors, such as (i) the industry vertical in which the product is applied,
(ii) the number of products the distributor orders, (iii) the prior established business
relationship between the Company and the distributor and (iv) estimated spending
budget of the distributor.

-  _Minimum purchase amount. There is typically no minimum purchase amount_
requirement.

-  _Scope_ _of_ _distribution._ The distribution agreements are non-exclusive, and
international distributors are typically restricted to distribute in designated
territories.

-  _Sub-distribution. Our distributors are generally not restricted from engaging_
sub-distributors. During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable
Date, to our knowledge, some of our distributors had engaged sub-distributors in
selling our products and solutions.

-  _Limitations on return or exchange. We generally do not accept returns or exchanges_
from our distributors, except for any quality issues with our products.

-  _Payment and credit terms. Payment for products by our distributors is generally due_
within 60 days from the end of the month the invoice is issued.

-  _Compliance with relevant laws. Our distributors are required to comply with all_
applicable laws in distributing our products.

-  _Termination. Typically, either party may terminate any renewal with prior notice. We_
may also terminate such agreements immediately upon any material breach by, or
the insolvency of, the distributor.

**Distribution model and accounting treatment**

We recognize revenue when our distributors accept the products according to the
contractual terms. Until revenue is recognized, these products remain classified as part of our
inventories.

Once ownership of the products has been transferred to the distributor, returns are no
longer permitted except for quality issues, and any requests for resolution must be addressed
through replacement procedures outlined in the distribution agreement. We can help facilitate
transfer of inventory to a third party upon the termination of their distribution agreements.
During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we had not repurchased
any products previously sold to distributors.


-----

**Our management of distributors**

To uphold high operational and brand standards, we continuously assess our distributors
throughout the year. We have implemented a thorough selection process to ensure that
prospective distributors are well-equipped to serve our end customers and effectively market
our products. Key criteria in our evaluation include their existing customer base, core product
offerings, established customer relationships, and warehousing capacity.

We collaborate closely with our distributors to provide ongoing operational support aimed
at driving their success and fostering sustainable growth. This includes offering training
sessions to enhance their team’s product knowledge and helping them manage inventory levels
more efficiently.

We conduct reviews of our distributors at fixed frequencies and take distributor
management actions such as regular evaluations, to continuously improve the quality
management level of distributors. We review our distributors based on a number of factors,
including (i) general background, such as their qualifications, scope of operations, business
scale, relevant industry experience, local distribution network, geographical points of sale
coverage, customer service capabilities, and sales and technical support capabilities, (ii)
synergy of products, for which we assess whether the other authorized products of the
distributors conflict with our products or whether there could be any synergy effect between
our products and their other authorized products, (iii) the capabilities of providing solutions
comprising different products to the customers, and (iv) systematic management, for which we
assess whether the distributors have well-established data infrastructure, including robust
customer relationship management systems and sales data analytics capabilities.

**Direct sales**

Our direct sales are primarily focused on serving leading strategic customers within the
AI server, automotive electronics, industrial control and consumer electronics industries. Our
sales and marketing team is well-versed in the professional knowledge pertinent to our
products, enabling it to effectively communicate the value of our technologies and the
performance of our products. We believe that our direct sales help us consolidate and improve
our market shares and penetrate different industry verticals effectively.

Our direct sales are usually conducted under sales and purchase arrangements. We have
a buyer-seller relationship with our direct sales customers and we recognize revenue when they
accept our products upon delivery according to the contractual terms.


-----

**_Key terms of agreements with direct sales customers_**

The terms of the agreement with our direct sales customers vary depending on the specific
product or project and the result of our negotiation with each customer, but these agreements
generally contain the following terms:

**Duration ** Generally, one to three years with an automatic renewal term,
unless terminated earlier or otherwise agreed.

**BRANDING AND MARKETING**

**Branding**

We strive to enhance our brand awareness by delivering superior product quality, reliable
performance, professional technical support services, and collaborative R&D capabilities,
complemented by targeted marketing initiatives. We believe that the most effective form of
marketing in our industry stems from building a strong market reputation rooted in these core
strengths. Specifically, our sales and marketing strategy is designed to build brand recognition,
increase demand for our products and solutions, foster long-term strategic partnerships with
customers, drive cross-selling opportunities, and unlock incremental business potential.

Leveraging our established brand value and customer-centric operational strengths, we
have built a large base of loyal clients across the semiconductor supply chain. We also deploy
a variety of targeted programs and activities, such as participating in renowned industry
conventions and exhibitions, to showcase our technical advantages and promote our products
and solutions to a broader range of potential partners.

**Sales and Marketing/Customer Technical Support**

We also focus our sales and marketing strategy on establishing business and technology
relationships with industry-leading module manufacturers and end-product brand owners, in
order to work closely with them on future semiconductor solutions that align with their product
road maps. Our engineers collaborate with our customers’ engineers to create products that
comply with their specifications and provide a high level of performance at competitive prices.
We also market our products directly to servers, automotive, PCs and smartphone
manufacturers so that our products can be qualified for their specifications and designed into
their products.

Our sales and marketing team boasts a high level of technical expertise and industry
knowledge, enabling them to effectively support a lengthy and complex sales process. As of
September 30, 2025, we had a dedicated sales and marketing team of 66 full-time employees.
This team includes a highly trained group of product managers and field applications engineers
who are well equipped to address customer needs and provide solutions. Additionally, our team
is armed with extensive strategic marketing experience and a strong ability to identify and
capitalize on emerging market trends, ensuring we stay ahead in a dynamic industry landscape.
We also provide comprehensive technical support and assistance to potential and existing
customers, so as to facilitate a smooth integration of our solutions into their products. We
believe that the depth and quality of this design support are key to improving customers’ time
to market and maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction.


-----

We attend periodic technology forums that facilitate direct interaction between their
product development teams and our research and development teams. Also, our customers are
increasingly utilizing contract manufacturers while retaining design and key component
qualification activities. As this trend matures, we continually upgrade our sales operations and
manufacturing support to maximize our efficiency, flexibility and coordination with our
customers.

Key industry leaders who target mass market applications often conduct a rigorous
evaluation process to choose the most suitable semiconductor solutions for their upcoming
products. A supplier’s design emerging successful from the evaluation process is commonly
referred to as a “design win”. We work with our customers to design integrated solutions to
enhance the performance and efficiency of their products. We work extensively with our
customer’s management and engineers to help optimize our solution. After granting a design
win, our customer will then decide when to start mass production for the specific product based
on various factors including the competitiveness of their own product, the market demand for
the product and other factors. Through our relationships, we have developed considerable
expertise, and we use that expertise in assisting our customers to develop their products using
our technologies and products. We also provide reference designs and engineering design
review and engineering product evaluation testing and debugging services for our customers.

We believe that good customer support at a technical level is extremely important in
developing long term relationships with key customers. Once our solutions are incorporated
into our customer’s design, it will likely be used for the life cycle of the customer’s product
as a redesign, and subsequent requalification of the product would generally be time
consuming and expensive. After our customer begins production, our application engineers,
who are often geographically close to our end customers, would provide support. We believe
that our deep interaction with numerous levels of our customer’s management team helps us
understand our customers, fosters customer loyalty and increases visibility of the services that
we can offer.

We market our products through our sales and marketing team, who is responsible for
identifying suitable potential markets and customers. Our sales and marketing members are
equipped with knowledge and expertise, and are able to identify the requests of downstream
customers and provide technical support. They are at the forefront of emerging products and
technologies that appeal to our existing and potential customers and provide our customers
with pre-sale consultations and recommendations tailored to their needs.

We also focus our sales and marketing strategy on establishing business and technology
relationships with industry-leading module manufacturers and end-product brand owners, in
order to work closely with them on future semiconductor solutions that align with their product
road maps. Our dedicated sales and marketing team is responsible for formulating and
coordinating marketing activities and promotion campaigns. By leveraging our brand value and
our own marketing efforts, we have been able to build a large base of loyal customers. We
employ a variety of programs and marketing activities, such as attending well-acclaimed
industry conventions and exhibitions, to promote our brand and our products and solutions.

**ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE**

We recognize the importance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters to
the Company’s sustainable development and are continuously strengthening ESG integration
across all aspects of our operations. We remain committed to enhancing the global
competitiveness of our products and services, and to supporting the Company’s long-term
sustainable development by contributing positively to society and the environment. Upon

[REDACTED], we will comply with the Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting
Code set out in Appendix C2 to the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong Limited by publishing ESG reports annually to disclose the
Company’s ESG management to stakeholders.

**Corporate Governance**

**_ESG Governance_**

We fully recognize the importance of environmental and social responsibilities to our
business. To strengthen our ESG management, we have established a three-tier ESG
governance framework comprising the Board of Directors, the Strategy and Sustainability
Committee (to be established upon [REDACTED]), and the ESG Working Group. Within this
framework, the Board of Directors serves as the highest supervisory body and assumes ultimate
responsibility for ESG matters. The Strategy and Sustainability Committee, established under
the Board of Directors, is responsible for researching and managing the Company’s
development strategy, including recommending ESG strategies, principles, and policies,
organizing feasibility studies on sustainable development goals, periodically reviewing ESG
progress (with external professional support where needed), assessing ESG-related risks, and
adjusting sustainable development strategies in accordance with applicable regulations when
necessary. The Strategy and Sustainability Committee also reviews ESG reports and other
relevant ESG disclosures and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors for approval.
The ESG Working Group is responsible for implementing ESG management plans and
measures and for continually identifying, assessing, and reporting ESG-related risks and
improvement suggestions to ensure the effective implementation of the ESG management
system.

**_Business Ethics_**

We maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward all forms of corruption and strictly comply
with applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations, including but not limited to the
Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the People’s Republic of China and the Criminal Law of the
People’s Republic of China. We uphold robust codes of conduct and anti-corruption policies for
employees and partners, strictly prohibiting bribery and other improper payments in business
operations. This prohibition applies to all global business activities, whether involving
government officials or third-party professionals. Improper payments prohibited by this policy
include bribes, kickbacks, excessive gifts or hospitality, and any other payments made or
offered to secure an improper business advantage. We maintain accurate books and records that


-----

reflect transactions and asset dispositions in reasonable detail. Any requests for false invoices,
or for payments that are unusual, excessive, or insufficiently explained, must be refused and
reported immediately, and misleading, incomplete, or false entries in books and records are
strictly prohibited. We also ensure that marketing personnel comply with all applicable
promotion and advertising requirements.

We have implemented comprehensive internal control measures for anti-corruption and
anti-bribery, including:

-  Providing regular anti-corruption and anti-bribery compliance training for directors,
senior management, and employees;

-  Monitoring books, records, and accounts related to supplier management, tendering
and bidding processes, and financial payment management to identify any false,
misleading, or undisclosed entries; and

-  Establishing a whistleblowing mechanism and encouraging employees, suppliers,
customers, and other third parties to report suspected activities and policy
violations.

In addition, we have established a standardized whistleblowing intake mechanism to
ensure that all reports are handled in a timely and fair manner. We provide multiple reporting
channels for internal employees and external stakeholders and strictly protect the lawful rights
and interests of whistleblowers. We have established specialized investigation procedures to
ensure that every report undergoes an independent and objective investigation and verification.
Verified violations will be handled seriously in accordance with the policies of the Company
and applicable laws and regulations. We will adopt strict confidentiality measures regarding
reporting information and the identity of whistleblowers and strictly prohibit any form of
retaliation.

**ESG Risk Management**

We have established transparent and efficient channels to engage stakeholders and
maintain close communication with shareholders, governments, regulatory bodies, customers,
employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders through a range of online and offline methods. We
actively solicit and act on feedback from stakeholders regarding our ESG management and
continuously refine our ESG practices to meet stakeholder expectations. Based on our business
characteristics and stakeholder priorities, we have identified the following material ESG
topics, assessed their potential risks and strategic opportunities, and implemented effective
measures to address them. The ESG risks and opportunities we have identified include climate
change response, water resource management, waste management, employees, product
responsibility, intellectual property protection, supply chain management, and community
contribution.


-----

**Environment**

**_Climate Change Response_**

We have identified several climate-related risks that could adversely affect our business
operations, assessed their potential impact, and developed corresponding response plans. We
also closely monitor typhoon paths, intensity levels, and rainstorm warning signals issued by
meteorological authorities, and activate targeted emergency measures based on the warning
level to ensure personnel safety and business continuity.

We recognize the potential financial and reputational risks associated with environmental
matters, including risks arising from compliance with current environmental regulations and
stricter standards. For example, China’s carbon neutrality goals announced in 2020, which aim
to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, may
increase energy procurement costs as we may need to bear transition costs for sourcing green
energy, which may be more expensive than traditional energy, or for purchasing or upgrading
equipment.

We face competition in product quality, the ability to meet downstream customer
expectations, experience, and reputation. Rapid technological change and evolving industry
standards have intensified this competition. We also recognize that climate-related issues pose
additional risks to our business.

**Category** **Potential impact**


**Physical risks ** Acute risks (e.g.,
typhoons, floods)
and chronic risks
(e.g., rising sea
level, continuous
shifts in climate
patterns)


Acute and chronic risks may disrupt the
continuity of the Company’s office
and R&D activities, creating
uncertainty in R&D progress, project
delivery cadence, and customer
communication efficiency. These risks
may also propagate through upstream
wafer foundry, packaging, testing, and
logistics links, increasing the
complexity of supply chain
coordination and product delivery
management, and potentially affecting
the Company’s fulfillment capabilities
and customer satisfaction.


-----

**Category** **Potential impact**


**Transition risks** Policy risks (arising
from continuously
tightening carbon
emission
regulations) and
Reputation risks
(driven by rising
stakeholder
expectations for
green development)


As climate and sustainable development
regulations strengthen at global and
regional levels, and as customers and

[REDACTED] pay greater attention
to ESG disclosures, the Company may
face transition risks in information
disclosure, compliance management,
and supply chain responsibility
management, which could increase
management costs. In addition, as
customers and [REDACTED] place
more emphasis on supply chain
sustainability, heightened focus on the
full lifecycle environmental
performance of chip products and
supply chain practices may prompt the
Company to invest more resources in
supplier screening, partnership
management, and sustainable
procurement to meet market and
regulatory expectations and maintain
competitiveness.

certification, creating a joint defense that spans quality, reliability, and environmental
responsibility.

We have established a standardized product recall management mechanism along with
formal processes for product anomaly feedback, failure analysis, and quality investigations,
using closed-loop tools such as 8D reports for batch issues. When a product requires recall due
to potential issues, this mechanism enables a rapid response. The sales department acts as the
unified external liaison and coordinates with customers on recall scope, reasons, and handling
plans, and initiates return authorization requests in the internal system. After approval through
a cross-departmental joint review, the Company conducts product recovery, testing, and
replacement in accordance with established procedures, ensuring each batch recall is recorded,
analyzed, and optimized through the closed-loop traceability system.

To strengthen quality traceability and risk prevention, we have built a digital platform that
covers customer complaints, process data, and product history. This continuously enhances
customer supply chain stability and product reliability.

**_Intellectual Property Protection_**

We continue to increase investment in R&D, including green products. To protect our
innovation outcomes, the Company has established internal regulations such as the patent
management system and is systematically building an intellectual property protection
framework to safeguard core technologies and trade secrets.

We have developed a system that covers the entire process from wafer manufacturing to
packaging and testing. Through end-to-end quantitative monitoring and systematic analysis, we
identify and eliminate potential defects before products leave the factory, which reduces
electronic waste and its environmental impact. Furthermore, by improving chip operating
efficiency and integration, we reduce resource and energy consumption per unit of product
during production and use, putting the concept of green manufacturing into practice.

**_Supply Chain Management_**

We are committed to strengthening the sustainable management of our supply chain. Our
measures include implementing systematic environmental and social responsibility risk
management for suppliers and promoting carbon reduction across the entire supply chain. In
our supplier performance evaluation system, we plan to incorporate ESG-related indicators,
including low-carbon and social responsibility metrics, as key scoring dimensions.


-----

We have established a standardized, transparent, and forward-looking supplier social
responsibility assessment system with clear “red lines” that prohibit child labor, forced labor,
commercial bribery, and major safety and environmental incidents.

Upholding fairness and transparency, we seek long-term and stable strategic partnerships
with suppliers. Through regular communication, we respond to supplier needs, optimize
cooperation processes, and actively promote green development strategies, guiding suppliers to
practice sustainable development and jointly advance carbon footprint reduction. Together with
upstream and downstream partners, we deepen information sharing and resource
complementarity to enhance the stability and overall competitiveness of the supply chain and
to help drive the industry toward a sustainable future.

**_Community Contribution_**

We actively fulfill our social responsibilities and contribute corporate strength to society.
We are committed to aligning business development with social responsibility by participating
in community development, education support, emergency relief, environmental protection,
and cultural and sports initiatives. To practice corporate citizenship systematically, we support
education and medical welfare by establishing special charitable funds and making targeted
donations. In 2025, we donated RMB100,000 to “Chip in for Little Livers” jointly organized
by SMIC, Shanghai Renji Hospital, and China Soong Ching Ling Foundation, to fund surgical
treatment for children with end-stage liver disease. Looking ahead, we will continue to work
with all sectors of society to create sustainable social value.

**COMPETITION**

The markets for our products and solutions are, in general, intensely competitive,
characterized by continuous technological change, evolving industry standards, and fluctuating
average selling prices.

Our competitors include large domestic and international semiconductor companies who
may have greater presence in key markets, a more established and larger customer base, and,
in general, better access to other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to adapt
more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements or devote greater
resources to the promotion and sale of their products. For a description of the semiconductor
industry’s market environment, please refer to the “Industry Overview” section.

We recognize the importance of talents for sustainable business growth and competitive
advantages. We believe that our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate
qualified personnel. We adopt a diversified recruitment approach to ensure a sufficient talent
pool for key positions. We recruit employees primarily through referrals, online job portals and
campus job fairs. We offer new employee orientation training and regular on-the-job training
to our employees. In particular, we provide a special training program which lasts for two to
three weeks for our R&D employees to help them get familiar with R&D activities and project
management. Our experienced engineers also conduct tutoring with new R&D employees.

Sharing success with employees and empowering them to grow is one of the core
elements of our corporate culture. We always strive to provide employees with comprehensive
social benefits, a safe working environment and diverse career development opportunities.
Meanwhile, we strictly abide by the laws, regulations and standards on workplace safety in
relevant countries and regions, and are committed to creating a safe and healthy working
environment for employees, and ensuring the safety and physical and mental health of
employees by implementing a highly efficient management system.

As part of our human resources strategy, we provide our employees with relatively
competitive salaries, performance-based bonuses and other incentive arrangements. In
addition, we have implemented a series of long-term equity incentive schemes covering our
core management team, key technical personnel and backbone employees in crucial positions,
thereby closely aligning such employees’ personal development with the Company’s long-term
interests. The grant, vesting and exercise conditions under this equity incentive scheme are


-----

closely tied to employees’ annual performance appraisals, contributions, length of service and
the attainment of the Company’s strategic objectives, with a view to fostering sustained
long-term commitment and a strong sense of ownership. We review employee performance
from time to time based on, among other criteria, their ability to achieve prescribed
performance targets. The remuneration and benefits package of our employees generally
comprises salaries, bonuses and equity incentive entitlements, and is generally determined by
reference to factors including seniority, performance evaluation, length of service and the
criticality of the relevant role. We also endeavour to maintain a multi-tier incentive framework
and a supportive working environment to enable employees to fully realise their potential. As
a result, we have generally been able to attract and retain qualified personnel and maintain a
stable core management team, thereby strengthening our talent foundation for the Company’s
sustained and healthy development.

During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we did not
experience any material labor disputes or strikes that may have a material and adverse effect
on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**

Owing to the efforts of our R&D team, we have been able to develop and own a series
of important intellectual properties and several key technologies that are critical to our
business operations. As of the Latest Practicable Date, we owned 76 patents, nine software
copyrights, and 78 composition designs around the globe.

To protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, we enter into framework
agreements with our suppliers imposing confidentiality obligations to protect our intellectual
property rights during the manufacturing. We have adopted a number of internal control
policies and measures to protect our intellectual property rights and trade secrets: (i)
implementing internal policy to establish robust management over our intellectual property
rights, (ii) timely registration, filing and application for ownership of our intellectual
properties, (iii) actively tracking the registration and authorization status of intellectual
properties and take action in a timely manner if any potential conflicts with our intellectual
properties are identified, and (iv) engaging professional intellectual property service providers.

We rely on confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests in proprietary know-how
that are not patentable and manufacturing processes for which patents are difficult to enforce.
There is no guarantee that we will prevail on patent infringement claims against third parties,
and we cannot assure you that our products do not infringe patents held by others or that they
will not in the future. To the best of our knowledge, information and belief, during the Track
Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we had not been subject to any material
intellectual property rights claims by third parties.

**DATA PRIVACY AND INFORMATION SECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT**

We place significant emphasis on information security management, drawing on
international best practices in our operation, and we strive to provide a safe, secure
environment for our customers.

In the course of our business, we collect, store and process business data and transaction
data. As we only make transactions with enterprises, we do not intend to collect or process
personal data in the ordinary course of our business. To the extent that any non-sensitive
personal data is incidentally processed, for example, business contact details and job titles, we
will handle such data in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and industry standards.

We are committed to complying with applicable laws, regulations and industry standards.
We have formulated our network and information security emergency plan. By establishing a
high-standard information security management system that ensures full coverage, we have
laid a robust foundation for information security, benefitting both domestic and international
clientele. To strengthen our information security management system, we have implemented
key policies and frameworks to proactively assess and address cybersecurity risks, protecting
our assets and minimizing vulnerabilities.

In addition, we have established a remote disaster recovery system for our server by
setting up multiple memory for the same information and data of long time dimension on cloud,
local and remote locations. Even if the server is damaged due to the highest level of disasters
such as earthquakes, mudslides and other irresistible natural disasters, we believe that it can
safeguard and guarantee that the service and data can be completely restored within 24 hours.

All of our employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement with us, which
prohibits them from disclosing any confidential information relating to their work without our
consent. We have a comprehensive data backup system to encrypt and store data on servers in
different locations in order to minimize the risk of data loss. We also conduct data restoration
tests to examine the status of the backup system on a regular basis.

We will endeavor to maintain safeguards and continuously improve our controls to
support the security of our information assets and the continuity of our operations.
