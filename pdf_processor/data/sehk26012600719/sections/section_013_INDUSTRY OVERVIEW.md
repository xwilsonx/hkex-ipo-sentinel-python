total smartphone shipments grew from 22.6% to 27.2%, and is projected to further
increase to 31.3% by 2030, providing market space for the large-scale application of
closed-loop control and stabilization technologies. On the other hand, as basic
requirements for imaging stability and focusing performance in mainstream models
continue to rise, demand for closed-loop control and stabilization capabilities is
gradually extending from high-end models to mid-range models. In 2024, the
combined share of mid-range and high-end smartphones in global smartphone
shipments reached 65.5%, and this proportion is expected to reach 68.7% by 2030,
driving the continuous penetration of closed-loop and OIS lens driver chips across
a larger shipment base.

**ANALYSIS OF ENTRY BARRIERS**

**Technological barriers: long-term technological accumulation and full-chain R&D**
**capabilities**

The integrated circuit industry features high technological complexity, especially for
products such as memory chips and lens driver chips, which impose stringent requirements on
reliability, lifespan, power consumption, security, and system compatibility. This necessitates
that enterprises possess long-term technological accumulation and full-chain R&D capabilities.
Due to the potential risks such as code loss, lifespan attenuation, and system failure in chips,
customers are highly sensitive to reliability, requiring enterprises to build correction models
and reliability databases through years of mass production data accumulation and technological
iteration. In contrast, new entrants not only lack architectural design capabilities but also lack
long-term accumulated correction data, algorithm optimization experience, and system- and
platform-level verification systems, making it difficult to meet market-required performance
and reliability standards in the short term, thus forming a significant technological barrier. The
performance of closed-loop lens driver chips and OIS lens driver chips is closely tied to the
structure and performance of the motor itself, requiring adaptation for specific motor models.
The debugging capabilities and experience of customer support personnel are crucial for
ensuring the performance of customer products, which necessitates years of accumulation and
continuous investment.

**Barriers to industrial chain collaboration: stable upstream production capacity supply**
**and collaborative development with downstream customers**

On the upstream supply side, leading manufacturers have established long-term strategic
partnerships with foundries and packaging and testing giants, forming a solid capacity supply
barrier. In the field of memory chips, particularly, leading enterprises, relying on their huge
order scale and technological integration, can prioritize locking in scarce wafer production
capacity. Such deep integration not only ensures the continuity and stability of supply amid
industry cyclical fluctuations, but also makes it difficult for new entrants to obtain comparable
supply chain support within a short timeframe. On the downstream application side,
competitive barriers manifest as deep collaborative development with end customers. Unlike
traditional general-purpose sales models, leading chip design manufacturers often engage with
customers from the definition stage of their new products. This R&D collaboration model not
only significantly enhances customer stickiness but also allows manufacturers to closely align
with cutting-edge market demands, establishing a first-mover advantage when new generations
of products are launched.

**Customer resource barrier: high entry threshold and strong customer stickiness**

As the core component of electronic products, the stability and reliability of chips directly
impact the functional performance of terminal products. This makes downstream customers
particularly cautious when selecting suppliers, typically requiring extensive long-term,
full-process testing for reliability, compatibility, lifespan, and environmental factors.
Consequently, once a customer completes validation and integrates a specific chip into their
product platform, they are unlikely to switch solutions unless faced with quality or supply
issues, resulting in strong customer stickiness. Leading enterprises in the industry have
accumulated a large number of top terminal customers by virtue of stable quality and market
reputation. This first-mover advantage will further strengthen the trust barrier, making it
difficult for new entrants to enter the mainstream customer system in the absence of similar
customer cases and verification experience.

**Talent barrier: scarcity of and long development cycle for high-end interdisciplinary**
**professionals**

The integrated circuit industry heavily relies on interdisciplinary professionals skilled in
technology, management, and marketing. Key roles span digital/analog circuit design,
architecture definition, verification engineering, algorithm development, quality management,
supply chain coordination, and specialized sales, all of which require years of industry
experience and practical accumulation. Leading enterprises typically possess mature core R&D
and management teams, creating a strong talent aggregation effect. For new entrants, limited
brand influence and resources make it difficult to attract experienced professionals. Moreover,
they are unable to build a complete, experienced, and balanced cross-functional team in a short
period, making talent a significant limiting factor for their industry entry.

**Capital barrier: high-intensity R&D and pilot production investments**

The integrated circuit industry features high investment, long cycles, and significant
risks. Continuous and substantial financial support is crucial for enterprises to maintain
technological advancement, process leadership, and product competitiveness. Throughout
various stages from product design to pilot production, enterprises not only have to bear
substantial labor costs, but also need to invest in high tape-out fees, testing fees, and various
verification and optimization expenses. These costs are often cyclical and incompressible. New
entrants lacking sufficient financial resources will struggle to sustain ongoing R&D
investments and will be unable to compete with leading enterprises that have already
established scale advantages and technological accumulation in the market.
