**ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT ON HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE**
**DIRECTORS** **OF** **GIANTEC** **SEMICONDUCTOR** **CORPORATION** **AND** **CHINA**
**INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL CORPORATION HONG KONG SECURITIES LIMITED**

**Introduction**

We report on the historical financial information of Giantec Semiconductor Corporation
(the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, the “Group”) set out on pages I-[●] to I-[●],
which comprises the consolidated statements of profit or loss, statements of comprehensive
income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group for each of
the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2024 (the “Relevant Periods”), and the consolidated
statements of financial position of the Group and the statements of financial position of the
Company as at 31 December 2023 and 2024 and material accounting policy information and
other explanatory information (together, the “Historical Financial Information”). The
Historical Financial Information set out on pages I-[●] to I-[●] forms an integral part of this
report, which has been prepared for inclusion in the document of the Company dated [●] (the
“Document”) in connection with the [REDACTED] of the shares of the Company on the Main
Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock Exchange”).

**Directors’ responsibility for the Historical Financial Information**

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Historical
Financial Information that gives a true and fair view in accordance with the basis of preparation
set out in note 2.1 to the Historical Financial Information, and for such internal control as the
directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the Historical Financial
Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Reporting accountants’ responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Historical Financial Information and to
report our opinion to you. We conducted our work in accordance with Hong Kong Standard on
Investment Circular Reporting Engagements 200 Accountants’ Reports on Historical Financial
_Information in Investment Circulars issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public_
Accountants (“HKICPA”). This standard requires that we comply with ethical standards and
plan and perform our work to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Historical
Financial Information is free from material misstatement.

Our work involved performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the Historical Financial Information. The procedures selected depend on the
reporting accountants’ judgement, including the assessment of risks of material misstatement
of the Historical Financial Information, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the reporting accountants consider internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation of the Historical Financial Information that gives a true and fair view in accordance
with the basis of preparation set out in note 2.1 to the Historical Financial Information, in order
to design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of


-----

expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Our work also
included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the Historical Financial Information.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the Historical Financial Information gives, for the purposes of the
accountants’ report, a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and the Company
as at 31 December 2023 and 2024 and of the financial performance and cash flows of the Group
for each of the Relevant Periods in accordance with the basis of preparation set out in note 2.1
to the Historical Financial Information.

**Review of interim financial information**

We have reviewed the interim financial information of the Group which comprises the
consolidated statements of profit or loss, statements of comprehensive income, statements of
changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the nine months ended 30 September 2024
and 2025, and the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group and the statement
of financial position of the Company as at 30 September 2025 and other explanatory
information (the “Interim Financial Information”). The directors of the Company are
responsible for the preparation of the Interim Financial Information in accordance with the
basis of preparation set out in note 2.1 to the Historical Financial Information. Our
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Interim Financial Information based on our
review. We conducted our review in accordance with Hong Kong Standard on Review
Engagements 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent
_Auditor of the Entity issued by the HKICPA. A review consists of making inquiries, primarily_
of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other
review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified
in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Based on our review, nothing has
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Interim Financial Information, for the
purposes of the accountants’ report, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
the basis of preparation set out in note 2.1 to the Historical Financial Information.

**Preparation of Historical Financial Information**

Set out below is the Historical Financial Information which forms an integral part of this
accountants’ report.

The financial statements of the Group for the Relevant Periods, on which the Historical
Financial Information is based, were audited by Ernst & Young in accordance with Hong Kong
Standards on Auditing issued by the HKICPA (the “Underlying Financial Statements”).

The unaudited interim financial Information in this report was prepared based on the
management accounts of the Group for the nine months ended 30 September 2024 and 2025.

The Historical Financial Information and the unaudited interim financial information are
presented in Renminbi (“RMB”) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (RMB’000)
except when otherwise indicated.

with the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance was audited by PKF Hong Kong, certified public accountants
registered in Hong Kong.

(iii) No audited financial statements have been prepared for these entities for the years ended 31 December 2023
and 2024.

**2.1** **BASIS OF PREPARATION**

The Historical Financial Information and the unaudited Interim Financial Information have been prepared in
accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, which comprise all standards and interpretations as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).

All IFRS Accounting Standards effective for the accounting period commencing from 1 January 2025, together
with the relevant transitional provisions, have been adopted by the Group in the preparation of the Historical
Financial Information and the unaudited Interim Financial Information throughout the Relevant Periods and the nine
months ended 30 September 2024 and 2025.

The Historical Financial Information and the unaudited Interim Financial Information have been prepared
under the historical cost convention, except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and equity
investments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income which have been measured at fair value.

**Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements include the Historical Financial Information of the Group for the
Relevant Periods and the nine months ended 30 September 2024 and 2025. A subsidiary is an entity (including a
structured entity), directly or indirectly, controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed,
or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give the Group the current ability to direct the relevant
activities of the investee).

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. When the Company has
less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and
circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:

(a) the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;

(b) rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and

(c) the Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.

The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company, using
consistent accounting policies. The results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains
control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.

Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the parent
of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit
balance. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions
between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are
changes to one or more of the three elements of control described above. A change in the ownership interest of a
subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.


-----

If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities,
any non-controlling interest and the exchange fluctuation reserve; and recognises the fair value of any investment
retained and any resulting surplus or deficit in profit or loss. The Group’s share of components previously recognised
in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss or retained profits, as appropriate, on the same basis
as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.

**2.2** **ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE IFRS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS**

The Group has not applied the following new and amended IFRS Accounting Standards, that have been issued
but are not yet effective, in the Historical Financial Information and the unaudited Interim Financial Information. The
Group intends to apply these new and amended IFRS Accounting Standards, if applicable, when they become
effective.

IFRS 18                     _Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements[2]_

IFRS 19 and its amendments        _Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures[2]_

Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7   _Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of_
_Financial Instruments[1]_

Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7   _Contracts Referencing Nature-dependent Electricity[1]_

Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28  _Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its_
_Associate or Joint Venture[3]_

Amendments to IAS 21           _Translation to a Hyperinflationary Presentation Currency[2]_

Annual Improvements to IFRS _Amendments to IFRS 1, IFRS 7, IFRS 9, IFRS 10 and IAS 7[1]_
Accounting Standards – Volume 11 

1 Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2026

2 Effective for annual/reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027

3 No mandatory effective date yet determined but available for adoption

The Group is in the process of making an assessment of the impact of these new and amended standards upon
initial application. IFRS 18 introduces new requirements on presentation within the statement of profit or loss,
including specific totals and subtotals. It also requires disclosure of management-defined performance measures in
a note and introduces new requirements for aggregation and disaggregation of financial information. The new
requirements are expected to impact the Group’s presentation of the statement of profit or loss and disclosures of the
Group’s financial performance. So far, the Group considers that the new and amended standards are unlikely to have
a significant impact on the Group’s results of operations and financial position.

**2.3** **MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION**

**Investment in an associate**

An associate is an entity in which the Group has a long-term interest of generally not less than 20% of the
equity voting rights and over which it has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in
the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies.

The Group’s investment in an associate is stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at the
Group’s share of net assets under the equity method of accounting, less any impairment losses.

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any retained
investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant
influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.


-----

**Fair value measurement**

The Group measures certain of its financial assets and equity investments at fair value at the end of each
reporting period. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the
presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for
the asset or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a
liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability,
assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that
would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data
are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of
unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the Historical Financial Information
and the unaudited Interim Financial Information are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows,
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1 – based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2 – based on valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is observable, either directly or indirectly

Level 3 – based on valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is unobservable

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the Historical Financial Information and the unaudited Interim
Financial Information on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in
the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

Where an indication of impairment exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required (other
than inventories, deferred tax assets, financial assets and non-current assets), the asset’s recoverable amount is
estimated. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s value in use and its fair
value less costs of disposal, and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows
that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, in which case the recoverable amount is
determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

An impairment loss is recognised only if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. In
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An
impairment loss is charged to the statement of profit or loss in the period in which it arises in those expense categories
consistent with the function of the impaired asset.

An assessment is made at the end of each reporting period as to whether there is an indication that previously
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable
amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss of an asset other than goodwill is reversed only if there
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of that asset, but not to an amount higher
than the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any depreciation/amortisation) had no impairment
loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of such an impairment loss is credited to the statement
of profit or loss in the period in which it arises.

**Related parties**

A party is considered to be related to the Group if:

(a) the party is a person or a close member of that person’s family and that person

(i) has control or joint control over the Group;

(ii) has significant influence over the Group; or

(iii) is a member of the key management personnel of the Group or of a parent of the Group;

or

(b) the party is an entity where any of the following conditions applies:

(i) the entity and the Group are members of the same group;

(ii) one entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or of a parent, subsidiary or fellow
subsidiary of the other entity);

(iii) the entity and the Group are joint ventures of the same third party;

(iv) one entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity;

(v) the entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the Group or
an entity related to the Group;

(vi) the entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a);

(vii) a person identified in (a)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key
management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity); and

(viii) the entity, or any member of a group of which it is a part, provides key management personnel
services to the Group or to the parent of the Group.

**Property, plant and equipment and depreciation**

Property, plant and equipment, other than construction in progress, are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any impairment losses. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase
price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended
use.

Expenditure incurred after items of property, plant and equipment have been put into operation, such as repairs
and maintenance, is normally charged to the statement of profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred. In
situations where the recognition criteria are satisfied, the expenditure for a major inspection is capitalised in the
carrying amount of the asset as a replacement. Where significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required
to be replaced at intervals, the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and
depreciates them accordingly.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis to write off the cost of each item of property, plant and
equipment to its residual value over its estimated useful life. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are as
follows:

Buildings                2.71% to 9.50%
Motor vehicles            19.00%
Machinery               9.50% to 19.00%
Electronic equipment         19.00%
Other equipment           19.00%
Leasehold improvements      Shorter of remaining lease terms and estimated useful lives


-----

_(b)_ _Lease liabilities_

Lease liabilities are recognised at the commencement date of the lease at the present value of lease
payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance
fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate,
and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise
price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for
termination of a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate the lease. The
variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the period
in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the
lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the
commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced
for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a
modification, a change in the lease term, a change in lease payments (e.g., a change to future lease payments
resulting from a change in an index or rate) or a change in assessment of an option to purchase the underlying
asset.

_(c)_ _Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of buildings (that
is those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain
a purchase option). It also applies the recognition exemption for leases of low-value assets to leases of office
equipment that is considered to be of low value.

Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as an expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

**Investments and other financial assets**

**_Initial recognition and measurement_**

Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value
through other comprehensive income, and fair value through profit or loss.

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash
flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that
do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient of not
adjusting the effect of a significant financing component, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair
value plus in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables
that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are
measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15 in accordance with the policies set out for “Revenue
recognition” below.

In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through other
comprehensive income, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (“SPPI”)
on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified and measured
at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model.

The Group’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order
to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual
cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost are held
within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, while
financial assets classified and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are held within a business
model with the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash flows and selling. Financial assets which are not
held within the aforementioned business models are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by
regulation or convention in the marketplace are recognised on the trade date, that is, the date that the Group commits
to purchase or sell the asset.


-----

**_Subsequent measurement_**

The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as follows:

_Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)_

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are
subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is
derecognised, modified or impaired.

_Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity investments)_

Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity
investments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income when they meet the definition of
equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is
determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.

Gains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to the statement of profit or loss. Dividends
are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been
established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the
financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in other comprehensive income. Equity investments
designated at fair value through other comprehensive income are not subject to impairment assessment.

_Financial investments at fair value through profit or loss_

Financial investments at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position
at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

This category includes derivative instruments and equity investments which the Group had not
irrevocably elected to classify at fair value through other comprehensive income. Dividends on the equity
investments are also recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment
has been established.

**Derecognition of financial assets**

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets)
is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position) when:

-  the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or

-  the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation
to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a “pass-through”
arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through
arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risk and rewards of ownership of the asset. When
it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of
the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement.
In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are
measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.

Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower
of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be
required to repay.


-----

**Impairment of financial assets**

The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) for all debt instruments not held at fair
value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance
with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the
original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or
other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.

**_General approach_**

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase
in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are
possible within the next 12 months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over
the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased
significantly since initial recognition. When making the assessment, the Group compares the risk of a default
occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial
instrument as at the date of initial recognition and considers reasonable and supportable information that is available
without undue cost or effort, including historical and forward-looking information. The Group considers that there
has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.

The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due. However,
in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information
indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account
any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation
of recovering the contractual cash flows.

Financial assets at amortised cost are subject to impairment under the general approach and they are classified
within the following stages for measurement of ECLs except for trade receivables which apply the simplified
approach as detailed below.

Stage 1 – Financial instruments for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial
recognition and for which the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month
ECLs

Stage 2 – Financial instruments for which credit risk has increased significantly since initial
recognition but that are not credit-impaired financial assets and for which the loss allowance
is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs

Stage 3 – Financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date (but that are not purchased or
originated credit-impaired) and for which the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal
to lifetime ECLs

**_Simplified approach_**

For trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or when the Group applies the
practical expedient of not adjusting the effect of a significant financing component, the Group applies the simplified
approach in calculating ECLs. Under the simplified approach, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but
instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a
provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific
to the debtors and the economic environment.

**Financial liabilities**

**_Initial recognition and measurement_**

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as payables.


-----

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of payables, net of directly
attributable transaction costs.

The Group’s financial liabilities include trade payables, other payables and accruals.

**_Subsequent measurement_**

The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows:

_Financial liabilities at amortised cost (trade and other payables)_

After initial recognition, trade and other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using
the effective interest rate method unless the effect of discounting would be immaterial, in which case they are
stated at cost. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the liabilities are
derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or
costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included
in finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.

**Derecognition of financial liabilities**

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled, or
expires.

When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as
a derecognition of the original liability and a recognition of a new liability, and the difference between the respective
carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the weighted average
cost basis and, in the case of work in progress and finished goods, comprises direct materials, processing costs and
other costs. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling prices less any estimated costs to be incurred to
completion and disposal.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash on hand and at banks, and
short-term highly liquid deposits with a maturity of generally within three months that are readily convertible into
known amounts of cash, subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and held for the purpose of meeting
short-term cash commitments.

For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand
and at banks as defined above.

**Income tax**

Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss
is recognised outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the
taxation authorities, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of
the reporting period, taking into consideration interpretations and practices prevailing in the countries in which the
Group operates.

Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the end of the reporting
period between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.


-----

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:

-  when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in
a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible
temporary differences; and

-  in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and an associate,
when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that
the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, and the carryforward of unused tax
credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit
will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carryforward of unused tax credits and
unused tax losses can be utilised, except:

-  when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary differences arises from the initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time
of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and does not give rise
to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences; and

-  in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and an
associate, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary
differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the
temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred
tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are
recognised to the extent that it has become probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part
of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if and only if the Group has a legally enforceable right
to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which
intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities
simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected
to be settled or recovered.

**Government grants**

Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be
received and all attaching conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is
recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the costs, for which it is intended to compensate,
are expensed.

Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred income account and is released to
the statement of profit or loss over the expected useful life of the relevant asset by equal annual instalments.

**Revenue recognition**

**_Revenue from contracts with customers_**

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of goods or services is transferred to the
customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services.


-----

When the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the amount of consideration is estimated to
which the Group will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods or services to the customer. The variable
consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue
reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the
variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

Sales contracts between the Group and its customers include performance obligations to transfer chips, which
are satisfied at a point in time.

The Group generates revenue from the sale of chips, including sales from direct selling model and sales from
distribution arrangements, which is recognised at the point in time when control of the assets is transferred to the
customers, which is the point of acceptance by the customers according to the contract.

**Other income**

Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis using the effective interest method by applying the rate that
exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter
period, when appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.

**Contract liabilities**

A contract liability is recognised when a payment is received or a payment is due (whichever is earlier) from
a customer before the Group transfers the related goods or services. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue
when the Group performs under the contract (i.e., transfers control of the related goods or services to the customer).

**Share-based payments**

The Company operates restricted A share incentive schemes for the purpose of providing incentives and
rewards to eligible participants who contribute to the success of the Group’s operations. Employees (including
directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render
services in exchange for equity instruments (“equity-settled transactions”).

The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date
at which they are granted. The fair value of restricted A shares for employees is determined by an external valuer
using the Black-Scholes formula. Since there are no cash settlement alternatives, the Group accounts for the restricted
A-share incentive schemes as equity-settled share-based schemes, further details of which are given in note 33 to the
Historical Financial Information.

The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised in employee benefit expense, together with a
corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at the end of each reporting period until the vesting
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity
instruments that will ultimately vest. The charge or credit to profit or loss for a period represents the movement in
the cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.

Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant date
fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate
of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the
grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without an associated service requirement, are
considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and lead
to an immediate expensing of an award unless there are also service and/or performance conditions.

For awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not
been met, no expense is recognised. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are
treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other
performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.

The dilutive effect of outstanding awards is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of
earnings per share.

**Other employee benefits**

**_Pension scheme_**

The employees of the Group’s subsidiaries which operate in Chinese Mainland are required to participate in
a central pension scheme operated by the local municipal government. The Group is required to contribute a certain
percentage of their payroll costs to the central pension scheme. The contributions are charged to the statement of
profit or loss as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the central pension scheme.

**_Housing fund and other social insurances_**

The Group has participated in defined social security contribution schemes for its employees pursuant to the
relevant laws and regulations of the PRC. These include housing fund, basic medical insurance, unemployment
insurance, injury insurance and maternity insurance. The Group makes monthly contributions to the housing fund and
other social insurances. The contributions are charged to profit or loss on an accrual basis. The Group’s liability in
respect of these funds is limited to the contributions payable in each reporting period.

**Dividends**

Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they are approved by the shareholders in a general meeting.
Proposed final dividends are disclosed in the notes to the Historical Financial Information and the unaudited Interim
Financial Information.

**Foreign currencies**

The Historical Financial Information and the unaudited Interim Financial Information are presented in RMB,
which is the Company’s functional currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and
items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Foreign
currency transactions recorded by the entities in the Group are initially recorded using their respective functional
currency rates prevailing at the beginning of the month in which the transaction occurs. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency rates of exchange ruling at the
end of each reporting period. Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in the
statement of profit or loss.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rates at the beginning of the month in which the transaction occurs. Non-monetary items measured at fair
value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. The
gain or loss arising on translation of a non-monetary item measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition
of the gain or loss on change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation difference on the item whose fair value gain
or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income or profit or loss is also recognised in other comprehensive
income or profit or loss, respectively).

The functional currencies of certain overseas subsidiaries are currencies other than RMB. As at the end of the
reporting period, the assets and liabilities of these entities are translated into RMB at the exchange rates prevailing
at the end of the reporting period and their statements of profit or loss are translated into RMB at the exchange rates
that approximate to those prevailing at the dates of the transactions.

The resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the
exchange fluctuation reserve, except to the extent that the differences are attributable to non-controlling interests.

For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, the cash flows of the overseas subsidiary is
translated into RMB at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the cash flows. Frequently recurring cash flows of
the overseas subsidiary which arise throughout the year/period are translated into RMB at the weighted average
exchange rates for the year/period.

**3.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES**

The preparation of the Group’s Historical Financial Information and the unaudited Interim Financial
Information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and their accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent
liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of the assets or liabilities affected in the future.

**Judgements**

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements,
apart from those involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the
Historical Financial Information and the unaudited Interim Financial Information:

**_Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that
taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Significant
management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon
the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. Further details are
contained in note 31 to the Historical Financial Information and the unaudited Interim Financial Information.

**Estimation uncertainty**

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of each
reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year, are described below.

**_Provision for expected credit losses on trade receivables and other receivables_**

The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables. The provision rates are based on
days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns.

The provision matrix is initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates. The Group calibrated
the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. For instance, if forecast
economic conditions are expected to deteriorate over the next year which can lead to an increased number of defaults
in the retail sector, the historical default rates are adjusted. At each reporting date, the historical observed default
rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

The assessment of the correlation among historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and
ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and forecast economic
conditions. The Group’s historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be
representative of a customer’s actual default in the future. The information about the ECLs on the Group’s trade and
bills receivables and prepayments, other receivables and other assets is disclosed in note 24 and note 25 to the
Historical Financial Information and the unaudited Interim Financial Information, respectively.

**_Write-down of inventories to net realisable value_**

In accordance with the inventory accounting policy, the Group measures inventories at the lower of cost and
net realisable value, and accrues inventory price falling reserves for inventories whose costs are higher than net
realisable value, obsolete and unsaleable. The write-down of inventories to net realisable value is based on the
assessment of the marketability of inventories and their net realisable value. Identifying write-down of inventories
to net realisable value requires management to make judgements and estimates based on the availability of conclusive
evidence and taking into account factors such as the purpose for which the inventory is held and the impact of events
after the reporting period. The difference between the actual result and the original estimate will affect the book value
of the inventory and the accrual or reversal of the inventory depreciation reserves in the period in which the estimate
is changed.
