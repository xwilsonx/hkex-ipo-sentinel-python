**BASIS OF PREPARATION**

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of our historical financial
information and the unaudited interim financial information have been prepared in accordance
with IFRS Accounting Standards, which comprise all standards and interpretations as issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). Further details of the material
accounting policy information adopted are set out in Note 2.3 of the Accountants’ Report in
Appendix I to this document. Our historical financial information and the unaudited interim
financial information also complies with the applicable disclosure provisions of the Hong Kong
Listing Rules. The accounting policies set out in Note 2.3 of the Accountants’ Report in
Appendix I to this document have been applied consistently to Track Record Period presented
in our historical financial information and the unaudited interim financial information.

The preparation of historical financial information and the unaudited interim financial
information in conformity with IFRS Accounting Standards requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of
applying our Group’s accounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continuously
evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of
future events that might have a financial impact on the entity and that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the historical financial
information and the unaudited interim financial information are disclosed in Note 3 of the
Accountants’ Report in Appendix I to this document.

**MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

Our business and financial performance are influenced by a variety of macroeconomic
and industry-specific factors that affect the global economy and the semiconductor industry.

These include overall economic growth, developments in cloud computing and AI
infrastructure, latest government policies and regulations, fluctuations in material costs, and
the competitive landscape. Any adverse changes in these factors could dampen demand for our
products and materially impact our business and results of operations. In addition to these
general factors, the following specific factors have a more direct impact on our results of
operations:

**Industry Demands and Our Continued Ability to Capture Growth Opportunities**

Our business operations and financial performance are affected by industry demands,
which are highly correlated to downstream applications.

We have capitalized on the significant unmet need of the AI era for high-performance
memory chips and captured the various market opportunities brought by this development
trend. Our products now span core scenarios across AI infrastructure, automotive electronics,
industrial control, and consumer electronics. As we continue to leverage our memory chip


-----

technologies into emerging high growth verticals such as new energy systems, industrial power
and control and AIDC power supplies, we expect that the demand in these markets will also
have a material effect on our results of operations.

In addition, our continued ability to drive technological innovation, to maintain, expand
and upgrade our product portfolio, and to address evolving downstream requirements, are key
to our business growth and results of operations. To meet industry demands and maintain our
competitiveness, we focus on R&D to enrich our product portfolio and expand business
footprints. Building on our leadership in memory chips, we continually track industry trends
and long-term customer needs, and actively develop new memory and mixed signal chip
solutions that will create value for our customers and us.

**Our Ability to Maintain and Deepen Our Engagement with Existing Customers, and**
**Expand Our Customer Base**

Our performance is in part driven by our ability to expand and extend our relationship
with existing customers and attract new customers. We are committed to maintaining and
deepening relationships with existing customers while seek to continuously broadening our
customer base. Meeting customer demands requires not only competitive products but also
proven reliability. While memory chips may account for only a portion of our customers’
products, their performance and reliability are critical to the success of our customers’
downstream applications. We have emerged as the second largest DDR5 SPD chip provider in
the world, with over 40.0% market share by revenue in 2024, according to Frost & Sullivan.

Notably, our ability to meet customer demands is also reflected in our long-standing
relationships with globally renowned leading memory manufacturers and automotive and
consumer-electronics companies. Long-standing trust and collaboration open the door to
deeper engagement and more cross-selling opportunities. For example, in memory modules,
our long-standing SPD leadership opened the door to VPD for next-generation eSSD and CXL
memory expansion. In automotive electronics, we have expanded from displays and
infotainment to body, chassis, and electrified powertrain. In smartphones, we have broadened
from EEPROM into lens driver chips, increasing platform coverage with key customer
accounts.

In addition, our long-term growth and operating results will depend in part on our ability
to attract more customers across different verticals. Many of our customers apply our
semiconductor products and solutions across their operations to ensure consistent, high-quality
output and optimal experience of their own products for their end users. We expect to continue
to increase our investment in customer outreach, sales and marketing efforts to enhance brand
awareness and acquire new customers from various verticals. We believe that our efforts to
retain existing customers and attract new ones will have a positive long-term impact on our
business and results of operations.


-----

In 2023, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our research and
development expenses amounted to RMB160.8 million, RMB175.6 million and RMB146.5
million. We believe the further enhancement of our technologies is central to our future
development. We will continue to invest in our research and development activities, including
talent recruitment, and to deepen cooperation with global foundries and packaging and testing
service providers to ensure we remain at the forefront of EEPROM and DDR5 SPD chip
markets. As a result, we expect the investments and expenses associated with our technology
capabilities to continue to grow to support our business growth. We believe the investments in
technology will drive overall long-term growth.

**Manage Supply Chain and Improve Operational Efficiency**

Supply chain management capabilities have a direct and significant impact on our
business operations and financial results. As a fabless IC design company, we rely on
third-party foundries for wafer fabrication, packaging and testing. Building strong, long-term
partnerships with key production partners is essential to securing stable capacity allocation and
fostering close collaboration on the production end. This is particularly critical during periods
of high industry demand, where capacity allocation, reservation, and production scheduling
play a vital role. Accurate forecasting and communication of wafer demands are equally
important in avoiding costly delays and supply bottlenecks. We have also established a
comprehensive supplier management system to ensure our product quality, which requires all
core suppliers to hold an ISO 9001 Quality Management System certification. Our ability to
manage the supply chain and ensure product quality can impact our financial performance.

Looking ahead, we aim to maintain the resilience of our supply chains by strengthening
cooperation with top-tier suppliers worldwide and diversifying our suppliers. This approach
will help us secure a stable supply of critical materials, improve operational efficiency, and
better navigate an evolving market landscape.

**MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES**
**AND JUDGEMENTS**

**Revenue Recognition**

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of goods or services
is transferred to the customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which our
management expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

When the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the amount of
consideration is estimated to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods
or services to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and
constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of
cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable
consideration is subsequently resolved.

Sales contracts between us and our customers include performance obligations to transfer
chips, which are satisfied at a point in time.

We generate revenue from the sale of chips, including sales from direct selling model and
sales from distribution arrangements, which is recognized at the point in time when control of
the assets is transferred to customers, which is the point of acceptance by the customers
according to the contract.

**Fair Value Measurement**

We measure certain financial assets and equity investments at fair value at the end of each
reporting period. Fair value is the price that would be received by one to sell an asset, or the
price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset
or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the
asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by our
management. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that
market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market
participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market
participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use
or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

We use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances along with
sufficient data available for the fair value to be measured. This maximizes the use of relevant
observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs.


-----

All assets and liabilities for which the fair value is being measured or disclosed in the
historical financial information and the unaudited interim financial information are categorised
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1: based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities

Level 2: based on valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement is observable, either directly or
indirectly

Level 3: based on valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable

For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the historical financial information and the
unaudited interim financial information on a recurring basis, we determine whether transfers
have occurred between levels of the hierarchy by reassessing categorization (based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of
each reporting period.

**Write-Down of Inventories to Net realizable Value**

In accordance with the inventory accounting policy, we measure inventories at the lower
of cost and net realizable value, and accrues inventory price falling reserves for inventories
which their costs are higher than their net realizable value, or are obsolete and unsalable. The
write-down of inventories to net realizable value is based on the assessment of the
marketability of inventories and their net realizable value. Identifying write-down of
inventories to net realizable value requires our management to make judgements and estimates
based on the availability of conclusive evidence and taking into account factors such as the
purpose for which the inventory is held and the impact of events after the balance sheet date.
The difference between the actual result and the original estimate will affect the book value of
the inventory and the accrual or reversal of the inventory depreciation reserves in the period
in which the estimate is changed.

**Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation**

Property, plant and equipment, other than construction in progress, are calculated by cost
less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. The cost of an item of property, plant
and equipment comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the
asset to its working condition and location for its intended use.


-----

Expenditure incurred after items of property, plant and equipment have been put into
operation, such as repairs and maintenance, is normally charged to the statement of profit or
loss in the period in which it is incurred. In situations where the recognition criteria are
satisfied, the expenditure for a major inspection is capitalized in the carrying amount of the
asset as a replacement. Where significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required
to be replaced at intervals, we recognize such parts as individual assets with specific useful
lives and depreciate them accordingly.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of each item of
property, plant and equipment to its residual value over its estimated useful life. The principal
annual rates used for this purpose are as follows:

**Property Plant and Equipment** **Principal Annual Rates**

Buildings:  2.71% to 9.50%
Motor vehicles:  19.00%
Machinery: 9.50% to 19.00%
Electronic equipment:  19.00%
Other equipment:  19.00%
Leasehold improvements:  Shorter of remaining lease terms and
estimated useful lives

An item of property, plant and equipment including any significant part initially
recognized is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected
from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss on disposal or retirement recognized in profit or loss
in the reporting period the asset is derecognized is the difference between the net sales
proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant asset.

Construction in progress is stated at cost less any impairment losses, and is not
depreciated. It is reclassified to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment when
completed and ready for use.

months from the date of this document. After making reasonable inquiries of our management
about our working capital, the Sole Sponsor concurs with the views of our Directors.

We intend to finance our future working capital requirements and capital expenditures
primarily from cash expected to be generated from operating activities and funds raised from
financing activities, including the [REDACTED] we will receive from the [REDACTED].

not been any material change in the contingent liabilities of our Company since September 30,
2025.

**CAPITAL COMMITMENTS**

During the Track Record Period, we did not have any material capital commitment.

**CAPITAL EXPENDITURES**

Our capital expenditures are primarily related to acquisition of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets. In 2023, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2025,
our capital expenditures amounted to RMB33.1 million, RMB48.1 million and RMB40.2

**RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

Related party transactions are set out in Note 38 of the Accountants’ Report set out in
Appendix I to this document. Our Directors confirm that these transactions were conducted in
the ordinary and usual course of business and on an arm’s length basis.

**OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS**

As of the Latest Practicable Date, we had not entered into any financial guarantees or
other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any unconsolidated third parties.
In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and
classified as shareholders’ equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial
statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets
transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to
such entity. Moreover, we do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that
provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging
or product development services with us.

**QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT FINANCIAL RISKS**

Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks, including foreign currency risk,
credit risk and liquidity risk. Our overall risk management program focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on our
financial performance. Risk management is carried out by our senior management. For details,
see Note 41 of the Accountants’ Report set out in Appendix I to this document.

**Foreign Currency Risk**

We have transactional currency exposures. Such exposures arise from sales or purchases
by operating units in currencies other than the units’ functional currencies. See Note 41 of the
Accountants’ Report set out in Appendix I to this document for an illustration of the sensitivity
as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 and September 30, 2025 to a reasonably possible change
in the USD exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of our profit before tax (due
to changes in the retranslated value of monetary assets and liabilities).

**Credit Risk**

We trade only with recognized and creditworthy parties. It is our policy that all customers
who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition,
receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and our exposure to bad debts is not
significant.


-----

For other receivables and other assets, management makes periodic collective assessment
as well as individual assessment on the recoverability of other receivables based on historical
settlement records and past experience. Our Directors believe that there is no material credit
risk inherent in our outstanding balance of other receivables.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2024 and September 30, 2025, our Group had certain
concentrations of credit risk as our trade receivables of RMB31.9 million, RMB29.1 million
and RMB60.4 million were due from our largest customer of respective year/period, and our
trade receivables of RMB94.1 million, RMB68.6 million and RMB93.6 million were due from
our five largest customers of respective year/period. We seek to maintain strict control over our
outstanding receivables and have minimize credit risk.

See Note 41 of the Accountants’ Report set out in Appendix I to this document for an
illustration showing the credit quality and the maximum exposure to credit risk based on our
credit policy, which is mainly based on past due information unless other information is
available without undue cost or effort, and year-end staging classification as at the end of the
reporting period.

**Liquidity Risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations
due to shortage of funds. Our exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of
the maturities of financial assets and liabilities. Our objective is to maintain a balance for
continuity of funding to finance our working capital needs as well as capital expenditure.

See Note 41 of the Accountants’ Report set out in Appendix I to this document for the
maturity profile of our financial liabilities during the Track Record Period, based on the
contractual undiscounted payments.

**Capital Management**

The primary objectives of our capital management are to safeguard our ability to continue
as a going concern and to maintain healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and
maximize shareholders’ value.

We manage our capital structure and make adjustments to it in light of changes in
economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. To maintain or adjust
the capital structure, we may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to
shareholders or issue new shares. We are not subject to any externally imposed capital
requirements. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing
capital during the Track Record Period.

**DIVIDEND POLICY**

We may distribute dividends in the form of cash, stocks or a combination of cash and
stocks. Any proposed distribution of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board and the
approval of our shareholders. The Board may recommend a distribution of dividends in the
future after taking into account our results of operations, financial condition, business
prospects, operating requirements, capital requirements, payments by our subsidiaries of cash
dividends to us, statutory, regulatory and contractual considerations and any other factors that
the Board may deem relevant. A decision to declare or to pay any dividends in the future, and
the amount of such dividends, will hence depend on these factors. According to the applicable
PRC laws and our Articles of Association, we may pay dividends out of our profit after tax only
after we have made the (i) recovery of accumulated losses, if any; (ii) allocations to the
statutory reserve equivalent to 10% of our Company’s profit after tax, and, when the statutory
reserve reaches and is maintained at or above 50% of our Company’s total issued share capital,
no further allocations to this statutory reserve will be required; and (iii) allocations, if any, to
a discretionary common reserve as approved by our shareholders in a shareholders’ meeting.

Furthermore, as set forth in our Articles of Association, the accumulated profits
distributed in cash (including by means of share repurchase) for the most recent three years
shall in principle not be less than 30% of our Company’s annual average audited net profit
attributable to owners of our Company for the last three years.

There can be no assurance that a dividend will be proposed or declared in any given year.
The information on policies relating to dividends constitutes forward-looking statements,
which are not guarantees of future financial performance. Our actual future dividends or capital
distributions could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements as a result of many factors, including those described under “Forward-Looking
Statements” and “Risk Factors.”

During the Track Record Period, the total dividends we declared or paid were RMB106.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2023, RMB31.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2024 and RMB47.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.

Withholding taxes at a rate of 10% were levied on the aforementioned dividends paid to
(i) QFIIs, (ii) investors holding our A Shares through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect
regime, and (iii) investors holding our A Shares subject to selling restrictions pursuant to the
Notice on Issues Relating to the Implementation of Differential Individual Income Tax Policies
for Dividends from Listed Companies (《關於實施上市公司股利紅利差別化個人所得稅政策
有關問題的通知》).

**DISTRIBUTABLE RESERVES**

As of September 30, 2025, we had approximately RMB1,054.9 million of retained
earnings available for distribution to our shareholders.
