According to Frost & Sullivan, we are the only China-based supplier offering a full
spectrum, series-grade automotive-grade EEPROM portfolio as of the end of 2025. With our
first-mover advantage and the trend toward domestic sourcing by Chinese OEMs, our products
are deployed widely across multiple core in-vehicle modules by 16 of the world’s top 20 and
all of China’s top 20 car brands, as well as over 85% of China’s self-owned passenger car
brands. Given that automotive-grade certification typically takes a relatively long period, this
deep engagement model creates natural customer barriers and long-term stickiness. This
position not only reflects our technical strength, but also supports further market share gains
and consolidation of our leadership.

**_Memory chips for consumer electronics_**

Leveraging over 15 years of experience, we continually adopt product upgrades to
address unmet need in the AI-era. For example, as a basic memory component, our EEPROM
is widely used across consumer electronics end-products. AI is making consumer electronics
end-products smarter. As features evolve and categories emerge, the breadth and depth of
memory applications are rising, expanding the market for memory chips. We hold leading
global positions in several important sub-segments such as smartphones, LCD panels, and
Bluetooth modules, and our penetration continues to increase. We are also seizing opportunities
in edge AI, extending our product application into new categories to reinforce our growth
momentum.

For consumer electronics, our memory chip lineup includes high-performance EEPROM
and advanced NOR Flash products. We offer a full spectrum of EEPROM with densities from
1 Kb to 4 Mb. Our NOR Flash focuses on low-power SPI NOR, including products built on our
NORD platform covering a density range of 512 Kb to 64 Mb, with an ETOX-based reserve
from 32 Mb to 512 Mb to meet larger firmware needs of certain consumer electronics
end-products, giving customers tiered choices.

**Our Market Opportunities**

**_AI servers and AI PCs_**

-  As large-model training and inference scale up, global AI infrastructure is entering a new
development phase. AI servers that carry cloud computing and AI PCs with local
inference capability are both poised for explosive growth. According to Frost & Sullivan,
global shipments of AI servers will exceed 2.5 million units in 2025 and will reach 6.5
million units in 2030, with a CAGR of approximately 21.1% during the period, and AI PC
penetration rate will rise from 31.0% in 2025 to 85.0% in 2030.


-----

-  Faster deployment of AI infrastructure is increasing memory per system. In data centers,
mainstream AI servers typically deploy over 20 DDR5 DIMMs — double that of
traditional servers — and are increasingly configured with more DRAM and SSD
modules. On the device side, AI PCs are ramping up more rapidly and equipped with
higher-capacity DRAM and SSD configurations than traditional PCs. With both cloud and
devices expanding, system counts, and per-system content are rising in tandem,
significantly increasing the installed base of modules and corresponding memory chips.

-  Against this backdrop, our SPD chips, which are already in commercial deployment and
supporting DDR5, and our VPD chips for eSSD and CXL modules, which are currently
in the design-in stage, are poised to see adoption and/or wider deployment by leading
global cloud providers, server manufacturers, and AI-PC brands, broadening our
key-account coverage and penetrating across AI infrastructure.

**_Automotive electronics_**

-  The shift to smart, electric, and connected vehicles is accelerating, with E/E architectures
evolving toward domain and zonal control. The number of controllers for autonomous
driving, intelligent cockpit, body, chassis, and battery management is rising. The kinds
and counts of memory chips per vehicle are well above those in traditional ICE models,
moving from “a few critical nodes” to “multi-domain and multi-node.”

-  The automotive electronics EEPROM market is poised for explosive growth. Frost &
Sullivan estimates that the global automotive electronics EEPROM market will exceed
over US$700.0 million in 2030. As ADAS, cockpit, and electrified powertrain functions
roll out across more models and trims, the number of controllers per vehicle continues to
increase, and multiple modules for sensing, control, display, and power require dedicated
memory to support software operation and function management. Rising penetration
together with more memory points per vehicle is lifting total automotive-grade memory
consumption.

-  We supply EEPROM and NOR Flash for automotive electronics, and, given our products’
reliability and stability, we expect to penetrate more models and modules at global
automotive brands as the market expands.

-  Edge AI in consumer electronics is moving from early pilots to broad deployment across
many endpoints. According to Frost & Sullivan, global shipments of edge AI consumer
devices will exceed 700 million units in 2025 with penetration over 30.0%. Edge AI is
permeating smartphones, tablets and wearables, becoming a key direction for terminal
functionality.


-----

-  Consumer electronics have large unit volumes and broad user reach. Installed base and
replacement demand are high, as edge AI spreads across price tiers and product forms,
per-device memory consumption is trending up, creating a large and expanding
application space for memory chips.

-  Consumer electronics sector drives growth in the NOR Flash market, fueled by growing
demand for AIoT solutions and the accelerating deployment of edge AI devices, while the
booming TWS earphone and smartwatch market requires high-density, low-power NOR
Flash for complex firmware and instant-on connectivity, sustaining steady demand.
