Plan, the 2022 Restricted Share Incentive Plan, the 2023 Restricted Share Incentive Plan and
the 2025 Restricted Share Incentive Plan. Given no further restricted Shares will be granted
under the Restricted Share Incentive Plans after the [REDACTED], the terms of the Restricted
Share Incentive Plans are not subject to the provisions of Chapter 17 of the Listing Rules.

**_(i)_** **_Purpose_**

The purpose of the Restricted Share Incentive Plans is to improve our Company’s
long-term incentive mechanism, to attract and retain outstanding talents, to motivate our
management and key employees and to achieve our strategic development and business
objectives. The Restricted Share Incentive Plans are implemented to align the interests of the
Shareholders with the interests of our Group and employees which will benefit the sustained
development of our Group.

**_(ii)_** **_Administration_**

The Restricted Share Incentive Plans are subject to approval of the Shareholders’ meeting
and administration of the Board.

**_(iii) Participants_**

The participants of the Restricted Share Incentive Plans include our management and key
employees. The scope of participants excludes independent directors, supervisors of our
Company at the relevant time and shareholders or actual controller who individually or
collectively hold 5% or more of the A Shares of our Company and their spouse, parents and
children.

**_(iv)_** **_Maximum number of Shares_**

For the Restricted Share Incentive Plans, the Shares underlying the plans shall be A

one A Share within the agreed period at the grant price and is subject to a lock-up period. The
maximum number of restricted Shares that can be granted under each of the Restricted Shares
Incentive Plans are as follows, subject to adjustment as a result of our Company’s equity
distribution:

Restricted Share Incentive Plan and the 2022 Restricted Share Incentive Plan have been increased to
