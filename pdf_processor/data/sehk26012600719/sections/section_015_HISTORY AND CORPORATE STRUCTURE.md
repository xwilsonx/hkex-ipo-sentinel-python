with an initial registered capital of US$7,000,000.

**Equity Transfer in 2016 and Conversion into a Joint Stock Limited Company in 2018**

Mr. CHEN Zuotao saw the prospect of our Group and acquired approximately 73.46% of

Co., Ltd.* (上海天壕科技有限公司) (previously known as Jiangxi Heguang Investment
Management Co., Ltd.* (江西和光投資管理有限公司)), for a cash consideration of
US$24,829,918. The consideration of the Acquisition was determined after arm’s length
negotiation between the parties. He has been appointed as the chairman of the Board of
Directors and an executive Director of our Company since April 2017.

On September 26, 2018, our Company accomplished all procedures required to convert
from a limited liability company to a joint stock limited company. The registered share capital
of our Company immediately after its conversion into a joint stock company in September 2018
was RMB90,631,400.

**Listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange**

In December 2019, we completed the listing of our A Shares on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange STAR Market (SHSE: 688123). We offered a total of 30,210,467 A Shares in
connection with the listing, which represented 25% of our Company’s total share capital
immediately following the listing.

**Subsequent Shareholding Changes**

Subsequent to the completion of the A Share listing, there had been several instances of
share capital changes of our Company as a result of repurchase of A Shares under repurchase
mandates, issuance of A Shares under employee stock ownership plans, and conversion of
capital surplus into share capital. The total issued share capital of our Company was

**MAJOR ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS AND MERGERS**

We had not carried out any major acquisitions, disposals or mergers during the Track
Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date.

**OUR LISTING ON THE SHANGHAI STOCK EXCHANGE STAR MARKET AND**
**REASONS FOR THE [REDACTED] ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE**

Our Company has been listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market since
December 2019. Since our listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market and as of the
Latest Practicable Date, we had no instances of material non-compliance with the rules of the
Shanghai Stock Exchange and other applicable securities laws and regulations of the PRC in
any material respects, and, to the best knowledge of our Directors and having made all
reasonable enquiries, there was no material matter that should be brought to the [REDACTED]
attention in relation to our compliance record on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market.
Our PRC Legal Advisors are of the view that for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024
and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we have complied with the relevant laws and regulations
on A-share listing applicable to us in all material respects. Based on the view of our PRC Legal
Advisors as disclosed above and the independent due diligence conducted by the Sole Sponsor,
nothing has come to the Sole Sponsor’s attention that would cause them to disagree with the
Directors’ confirmation with regard to the compliance records of the Company on the Shanghai
Stock Exchange STAR Market during the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable
Date.

Our Company seeks to be [REDACTED] on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in order to
provide further capital for the development and expansion of our business, further enhance
overseas financing capabilities, further advance our global strategic footprint, and better attract
overseas investors and talents. See “Business — Our Strategies” and “Future Plans and

[REDACTED]” for more details.
