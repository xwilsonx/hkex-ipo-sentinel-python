**FUTURE PLANS**

See “Business — Our Strategies” in this document for a detailed description of our future
plans.

[REDACTED]

Assuming an [REDACTED] of HK$[REDACTED] per H Share (being the mid-point of
the [REDACTED] of between HK$[REDACTED] and HK$[REDACTED] per H Share) and
that the [REDACTED] is not exercised, in line with our strategies, we intend to use our

[REDACTED] from the [REDACTED] for the purposes and in the amounts set forth below:

-  Approximately [REDACTED]% of the net [REDACTED], or HK$[REDACTED]
million, will be used to enhance the development of our core memory chip and
mixed signal technologies and the related design and processing platforms, with an
aim to solidify the core technology barriers underpinning our future product
portfolio and further drive the continuous expansion of our product matrix.
Specifically:

 Approximately [REDACTED]% of the net [REDACTED], or
HK$[REDACTED] million, will be used to maintain and further expand and
strengthen our R&D team. Over the next six years, we plan to focus on
recruiting and retaining R&D talents, in particular, product designers, testing
engineer, and technical support personnel, to support the development of our
next-generation memory chip products, mixed-signal chips and the related
supporting products, including (i) memory chip products featuring smaller
memory units, higher performance, and enhanced reliability; (ii) algorithms,
novel sensing technologies, and advanced packaging techniques for mixedsignal chip products; and (iii) new memory chip solutions to better capture
emerging industry trends. We will attract and retain R&D talents through
competitive incentive schemes and diverse and flexible collaboration models,
to strengthen our talent base with long-term value and further reinforce our
competitiveness;


-----

 Approximately [REDACTED]% of the net [REDACTED], or
HK$[REDACTED] million, will be used to strengthen our overseas team
outside China. Specifically, we plan to (i) attract well-regarded overseas
product design teams and talent; and (ii) establish joint R&D collaboration
with leading global R&D teams to support continuous technological upgrades
and the expansion of our global business; and

 Approximately [REDACTED]% of the net [REDACTED], or
HK$[REDACTED] million, will be used for overseas market expansion and
the related marketing activities, including conducting overseas branding
campaigns and participating in globally influential industry exhibitions, to
deepen our relationships with our global customers and further enhance our
visibility and influence in overseas markets;

-  Approximately [REDACTED]% of the net [REDACTED], or HK$[REDACTED]
million, will be used for strategic investments and/or acquisitions, with a focus on
investment and acquisition opportunities that offer synergies with our existing
product portfolio, enhance our design capabilities, process technology and supply
chain capabilities, and support horizontal expansion into emerging areas. We will
seek potential strategic investment and acquisition opportunities globally, focusing
on chip design companies that are industry-leading, possess high barriers to entry,
generate synergies with our existing business or sales channels, and align with
industry development trends. We will adopt a prudent and open approach to identify
high-quality targets that match our strategic direction, and based on thorough
evaluation, steadily advance strategic investments and resource integration to
achieve rapid enhancement of technological capabilities and accelerated expansion
of our product lines. As of the Latest Practicable Date, we had not identified any
target of potential acquisition; and

-  Approximately [REDACTED]% of the net [REDACTED], or HK$[REDACTED]
million, will be used for working capital and general corporate uses.

In the event that the [REDACTED] is set at the [REDACTED] or the [REDACTED] of
the indicative [REDACTED], the net [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED] will increase or
decrease by approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, respectively. If we make an upward or
downward [REDACTED] adjustment to set the final [REDACTED] to be above or below the
mid-point of the [REDACTED], we will increase or decrease the allocation of the

[REDACTED] to the above purposes on a pro rata basis.

The additional net [REDACTED] that we would receive if the [REDACTED] was
exercised in full would be (i) HK$[REDACTED] million (assuming an [REDACTED] of
HK$[REDACTED] per H Share, being the [REDACTED]), (ii) HK$[REDACTED] million
(assuming an [REDACTED] of HK$[REDACTED] per H Share, being the mid-point of the

[REDACTED]) and (iii) HK$[REDACTED] million (assuming an [REDACTED] of
HK$[REDACTED] per H Share, being the [REDACTED]).


-----

To the extent that the net [REDACTED] from the [REDACTED] (including the net

[REDACTED] from the exercise of the [REDACTED]) are either more or less than expected,
we may adjust our allocation of the net [REDACTED] for the above purposes on a pro rata
basis.

We will only place the net [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED] that are not immediately
required for the above purposes in short-term interest-bearing accounts at licensed commercial
banks and/or authorized financial institutions as defined under the SFO or applicable laws and
regulations in other jurisdictions so long as it is deemed to be in the best interests of our
Company. In such event, we will comply with the appropriate disclosure requirements under
the Listing Rules.
