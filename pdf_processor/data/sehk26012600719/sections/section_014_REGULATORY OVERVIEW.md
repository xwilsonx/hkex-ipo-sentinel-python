resolutions of a shareholders’ meeting shall be passed by more than one-half of the voting
rights held by the shareholders present at the meeting. Resolutions of a shareholders’ meeting
in respect of amendments to the articles of association, increase or reduction of registered

also applies to foreign-invested companies. In cases where the special laws on foreign
investment provide otherwise, such provisions shall prevail.

The Foreign Investment Law of the PRC (中華人民共和國外商投資法) (the “FIL”),
which was promulgated by the NPC on March 15, 2019, and came into effect on January 1,
2020, defines “foreign investment” as investment activities conducted within China, either
directly or indirectly, by foreign individuals, enterprises or other organizations (collectively,
“Foreign Investors”). Such activities include the following categories: (1) a foreign investor
sets up a foreign-invested enterprise in the territory of China individually or jointly with any
other investor; (2) a foreign investor acquires shares, equities, property interests or other
similar rights and interests of an enterprise in the territory of China; (3) a foreign investor
invests in a new project in the territory of China individually or jointly with any other investor;
(4) investment in other ways as prescribed by laws, administrative regulations or
prescribed by the State Council. The FIL further adopts the management system of preestablishment national treatment and negative list for foreign investment. The “Preestablishment national treatment” referred to in the preceding paragraph means that the
treatment accorded to foreign investors and their investments at the stage of investment
access shall be no less favorable than that accorded to domestic investors and their
investments; “negative list referred to in the preceding paragraph means the special
administrative measures for the access of foreign investment in specific sectors as stipulated
by the State. The State accords national treatment to foreign investments outside the negative
list. The negative list shall be issued by, or with the approval of, the State Council.

In December 2019, the State Council promulgated the Regulations on Implementing the
Foreign Investment Law of the PRC (中華人民共和國外商投資法實施條例) (the
“Implementation Rules”) which came into effect in January 2020. The Implementation Rules
further clarified that the state shall encourage and promote foreign investment, protect the
lawful rights and interests in foreign investments, regulate foreign investment administration,
continue to optimize foreign investment environment and advance a higher-level opening.

Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors were principally governed by the
Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Access of Foreign Investment (2024
version) (外商投資准入特別管理措施(負面清單)(2024年版)), and the Catalogue of Industries
for Encouraging Foreign Investment (2022 version) (鼓勵外商投資產業目錄(2022年版)) (the
“Encouraging List”). In addition, the Catalogue of Industries for Encouraging Foreign
Investment (2025 Version) (鼓勵外商投資產業目錄(2025年版)) was promulgated on December
15, 2025 and will come into effect on February 1, 2026. The Negative List, which came into
effect on November 1, 2024, sets out special administrative measures (restricted or prohibited)
in respect of the access of foreign investments in a centralized manner, and the Encouraging
List, which came into effect on January 1, 2023, sets out the encouraged industries for foreign
investment. The Negative List covers 11 industries, and any field not falling in the Negative
List shall be administered under the principle of equal treatment for domestic and foreign
investment. Our business as currently conducted does not fall within the confines of the
Negative List and is not subject to special administrative measures.

The Measures on Reporting of Foreign Investment Information (外商投資信息報告辦法)
was released by Ministry of Commerce and the State Administration for Market Regulation
(the “SAMR”) on December 30, 2019, and became effective on January 1, 2020. Foreign
investors directly or indirectly conducting investment activities within the territory of China
shall submit the investment information through submission of initial reports, change reports,
deregistration reports, annual reports, etc. to the competent commerce authorities in
accordance with the Measures on Reporting of Foreign Investment Information. When
submitting an annual report, a foreign-invested enterprise shall submit the basic information on
the enterprise, the information on the investors and their actual controlling party, the
enterprise’s operation and asset and liabilities information, etc., and where the foreign
investment admission special administrative measures are involved, the foreign investment
enterprise shall also submit the relevant industry licensing information.

**Overseas Securities [REDACTED]**

The CSRC promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities
Offering and Listing by Domestic Enterprises (境內企業境外發行證券和上市管理試行辦法)
(the “Overseas Listing Trial Measures”) and five relevant guidelines on February 17, 2023,


-----

which took effect on March 31, 2023. The CSRC promulgated the Notice on the Filing
Administration Arrangements for Overseas Issuance and Listing of Domestic Enterprises (關
於境內企業境外發行上市備案管理安排的通知) on February 17, 2023, which came into force
on February 17, 2023.

The Overseas Listing Trial Measures comprehensively reformed the regulatory regime for
overseas offering and listing of PRC domestic companies’ securities, either directly or
indirectly, into a filing-based system. According to the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, the
PRC domestic companies that seek to offer and list securities in overseas markets, either in
direct or indirect means, are required to fulfill the filing procedure with the CSRC and report
relevant information. The Overseas Listing Trial Measures provides that an overseas listing or
offering is explicitly prohibited, if any of the following applies: (i) such securities offering or
listing is explicitly prohibited by provisions in PRC laws, administrative regulations or
relevant state rules; (ii) the proposed securities offering or listing may endanger national
security as reviewed and determined by competent authorities under the State Council in
accordance with laws; (iii) the domestic company intending to be listed or offer securities in
overseas markets, or its controlling shareholder(s) and the actual controller, have committed
crimes such as corruption, bribery, embezzlement, misappropriation of property or
undermining the order of the socialist market economy during the latest three years; (iv) the
domestic company intending to be listed or offer securities in overseas markets is currently
under investigations for suspicion of criminal offenses or major violations of laws and
regulations, and no conclusion has yet been made thereof; or (v) there are material ownership
disputes over equity held by the domestic company’s controlling shareholder(s) or by other
shareholder(s) that are controlled by the controlling shareholder(s) and/or actual controller.

Where an issuer submits an application for initial public offering to competent overseas
regulators, filing application with the CSRC shall be submitted within three business days
thereafter. Subsequent securities offering of an issuer in the same overseas market where it has
previously offered and listed securities shall be filed with the CSRC within three business days
after the offering is completed. Subsequent securities offering and listing of an issuer in other
overseas markets shall be filed as initial public offering.

Moreover, upon the occurrence of any of the material events specified below after an
issuer has offered and listed securities in an overseas market, the issuer shall submit a report
thereof to CSRC within three working days after the occurrence and public disclosure of the
event: (1) change of control; (2) investigations or sanctions imposed by overseas securities
regulatory agencies or other relevant competent authorities; (3) change of listing status or
transfer of listing segment; and (4) voluntary or mandatory delisting. Where an issuer’s main
business undergoes material changes after overseas offering and listing, and is therefore
beyond the scope of business stated in the filing documents, such issuer shall submit to the
CSRC an ad hoc report and a relevant legal opinion issued by a domestic law firm within three
working days after occurrence of the changes.
