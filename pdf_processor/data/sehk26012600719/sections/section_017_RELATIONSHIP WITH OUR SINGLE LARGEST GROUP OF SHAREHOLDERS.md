capital of our Company immediately following the completion of the [REDACTED], assuming
that no new Shares are issued under the [REDACTED] and our Restricted Share Incentive
Plans, and no other changes are made to the issued share capital of our Company between the
Latest Practicable Date and the [REDACTED].

Save for the business of our Group, each of our Single Largest Group of Shareholders
does not currently have any interest in a business that competes or is likely to compete, whether
directly or indirectly, with our Group’s business.

**INDEPENDENCE FROM OUR SINGLE LARGEST GROUP OF SHAREHOLDERS**

Having considered the following factors, our Directors are satisfied that we are capable
of carrying on our business independently from our Single Largest Group of Shareholders after
the [REDACTED].


-----

**Management Independence**

Our business is managed and conducted by our Board and senior management. Currently,
our Board consists of seven Directors, comprising three executive Directors and four
independent non-executive Directors, and we also have four senior management members.
Notwithstanding that Mr. CHEN Zuotao, chairman of the Board and an executive Director, is
a member of the Single Largest Group of Shareholders, our Directors believe that the Board
and senior management of our Company are able to operate our business independently of our
Single Largest Group of Shareholders for the following reasons:

(i) our Directors are aware of their fiduciary duties as a director, which require, among
other things, that they act for the benefits and in the interests of our Company and
all our Shareholders as a whole and do not allow any conflict between their duties
as a Director and their personal interests;

(ii) our daily management and operations are carried out by our executive Directors and
senior management team. As of the Latest Practicable Date, except from Mr. Chen,
none of them held any management position in the Single Largest Group of
Shareholders or their respective close associates. They also have substantial
experience in the industry in which our Company is engaged and will therefore be
able to make impartial and sound business decisions that are in the best interests of
our Group;

(iii) our Board has a balanced composition of executive, and independent non-executive
Directors, which ensures the independence of the Board in making decisions
affecting our Company. Our independent non-executive Directors account for more
than one-third of the Board, and do not and will not take up any position with our
Single Largest Group of Shareholders. All of our four independent non-executive
Directors are independent of the Single Largest Group of Shareholders and have
extensive experience in their respective areas of expertise. For details, see
“Directors and Senior Management.” All independent non-executive Directors are
appointed in accordance with the requirements under the Listing Rules, and certain
matters of our Company must always be referred to the independent non-executive
Directors for review, ensuring the decisions of the Board are made only after the due
consideration of independent and impartial opinions and in the best interests of our
Company and our Shareholders as a whole;

(iv) in the event that there is a potential conflict of interests arising out of any transaction
to be entered into between our Group and a Director or their respective close
associate, the interested Director(s) is required to declare the nature of such interests
before voting and shall abstain from voting in respect of such transaction and not be
counted towards the quorum at the relevant Board meetings of our Company in
respect of such transactions; and


-----

Shareholders. Our Company makes tax registration and pays tax independently with its own
funds. As such, our Company’s financial functions, such as cash and accounting management,
invoices and bills, operate independently of our Single Largest Group of Shareholders and their
respective close associates.

We have adequate financial resources and credit facilities to support our daily operation
without relying on any guarantee or security provided by our Single Largest Group of
Shareholders and their respective close associates. As of the Latest Practicable Date, there was
no outstanding loan, advance, balance of non-trade nature due to or from, or pledge or
guarantee provided by our Single Largest Group of Shareholders or their respective close
associates. We do not expect to rely on our Single Largest Group of Shareholders and their
close associates for financing after the [REDACTED] as we expect that our working capital
will be funded by cash flows generated from operating activities, equity financing, bank loans
as well as the [REDACTED] from the [REDACTED].

Based on the above, our Directors believe that we do not place undue reliance on our
Single Largest Group of Shareholders and their respective close associates.

**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MEASURES**

Our Directors recognize the importance of good corporate governance in protecting our
Shareholders’ interests. We would adopt the following measures to safeguard good corporate
governance standards and to avoid potential conflict of interests between our Group and our
Single Largest Group of Shareholders:

(i) where a Board meeting is held for the matters in which any Directors has a material
interest, such Director(s) shall abstain from voting on the relevant resolutions and
shall not be counted in the quorum for the voting;

(ii) where a Shareholders’ meeting is to be held for considering proposed transactions
in which any member of our Single Largest Group of Shareholders or any of their
associates has a material interest, the relevant member in our Single Largest Group
of Shareholders will not vote on the resolutions and shall not be counted in the
quorum in the voting;

(iii) our Company has established internal control mechanisms to identify connected
transactions. Upon the [REDACTED], if our Company enters into connected
transactions with any member of our Single Largest Group of Shareholders or any
of their associates, our Company will comply with the relevant requirements of
Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules, including the announcement, reporting and
independent Shareholders’ approval requirements (if applicable) under the Listing
Rules;

(iv) our Board will consist of a balanced composition of executive and independent
non-executive Directors, including not less than one-third of independent nonexecutive Directors, to ensure that our Board is able to effectively exercise


-----

independent judgment in its decision-making process and provide independent
advice to our Shareholders. We believe our independent non-executive Directors,
individually and collectively, possess sufficient knowledge and experience and are
free of any business or other relationship which could interfere in any material
manner with the exercise of their independent judgment and will be able to provide
an impartial, external opinion to protect the interests of our Shareholders as a whole;

(v) our independent non-executive Directors will review, on an annual basis, whether
there are any conflicts of interests between our Group and our Single Largest Group
of Shareholders and provide impartial and professional advice to protect the
interests of our minority Shareholders;

(vi) our Single Largest Group of Shareholders will provide our independent nonexecutive Directors with all relevant financial, operational and market and any other
necessary information as required by the independent non-executive Directors for
the purpose of their annual review;

(vii) our Company shall disclose the decisions of the independent non-executive
Directors either in its annual reports or by way of announcements as required by the
Listing Rules;

(viii) we have established our audit committee, remuneration and evaluation committee,
nomination committee and strategy committee with written terms of reference in
compliance with the Listing Rules and the Corporate Governance Code in Appendix
C1 to the Listing Rules;

(ix) where our Directors reasonably request the advice of independent professionals such
as financial advisors, the appointment of such independent professionals will be
made at our Company’s expenses;

(x) we have amended our Articles of Association to ensure compliance with the Listing
Rules, which will become effective upon [REDACTED]; and

(xi) we have appointed Altus Capital Limited as our Compliance Advisor, which will
provide advice and guidance to us in respect of compliance with the Listing Rules
and applicable laws, rules, codes and guidelines, including but not limited to various
requirements relating to Directors’ duties and internal controls.

Based on the above, our Directors are satisfied that sufficient corporate governance
measures have been put in place to manage conflicts of interests between our Group and our
Single Largest Group of Shareholders to protect minority Shareholders’ rights after the

[REDACTED].
