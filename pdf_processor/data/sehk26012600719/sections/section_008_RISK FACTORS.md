**RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY**

**The semiconductor industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. If we are unable**
**to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our sales, market share and**
**profitability could be adversely affected.**

We continue to face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and expect the
competition to intensify as more semiconductor companies enter the market and as our existing
competitors continue to develop new technologies and launch new products and solutions. We
are in direct and active competition with numerous competitors of varying size, technical
capability and financial strength, with respect to one or more of our business lines, including
memory chips, mixed-signal chips, NFC chips and other products. Many of our competitors
have longer operating histories, stronger presence in key markets, greater name recognition,
larger customer bases, more established strategic and financial relationships and greater
financial, sales and marketing, distribution, technical and other resources than we do. Some of
them also have their own manufacturing facilities, which in certain circumstances may give
them the ability to price their products and solutions more aggressively than we can, to respond
more rapidly to changing market opportunities than we can or to meet increased demands for
their products and solutions more easily.

Our competitors primarily include large domestic and international semiconductor
companies. Our competitors may have greater presence in key markets, greater access to
advanced wafer foundry capacity, a more established and larger customer base, and, in general,
better access to other resources than we do. In addition, downward pressure on pricing could
adversely affect our growth and profitability. From time to time, other companies may enter


-----

into our markets and provide similar services and products that we offer. These new entrants
may gain market share in the short term by pricing their semiconductor solutions significantly
below current market levels, which puts additional downward pressure on the prices we can
obtain for our solutions.

Some of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions or enter into partnerships
or other strategic relationships to achieve competitive advantages. In addition, new entrants not
currently considered our competitors may enter our markets through acquisitions, partnerships
or strategic relationships. Industry consolidation may also bring in competitors with more
comprehensive product offerings or greater pricing flexibility due to their expanded scale and
financial resources. Strategic arrangements between our competitors and our third-party
suppliers, including foundries and providers of packaging, testing and other back-end services,
could lead to preferential or exclusive arrangements benefiting our competitors while
impairing our ability to secure sufficient capacity from such suppliers, hence adversely
affecting our ability to meet customer demand for our solutions. In addition, competitors may
enter into exclusive relationships with distributors or certain existing or potential end users of
our solutions, which could reduce available distribution channels and demand for our solutions
and impair our ability to sell our solutions and grow our business. Some of our customers may
seek to develop their own semiconductor products and solutions which may compete with those
we currently offer.

In addition, increased competition in the semiconductor industry may result in rapid
technological change, evolving standards, reductions in product selling prices and rapid
product obsolescence. If we are unable to successfully cope with these competitive challenges,
we may be unable to maintain and grow our business. Our inability to compete successfully
could also adversely affect our results of operations and impair our financial condition.

**Price pressures from market competition and fluctuating market conditions may**
**negatively impact our revenue and gross profit margin.**

We have experienced and expect to continue facing price pressures due to increasingly
competitive conditions in the downstream markets we serve. We are faced with strong pricing
pressure that we continue to experience. Unless we can increase unit sales volume or
successfully introduce higher-value offerings, our revenue derived from existing products and
solutions may decline. Historically, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur
significant amount of research and development expenses in the long-term to develop new
products and solutions with more advanced features that can be sold at higher selling prices
and/or manufactured at lower cost. In 2023, 2024 and in the nine months ended September 30,
2025, our research and development expenses amounted to RMB160.8 million, RMB175.6
million, and RMB146.5 million, respectively. However, if we are unable to do so in a timely
manner, or if we are unable to successfully develop more cost-effective technologies, our
financial results could be adversely affected. Sustained pricing pressure could adversely affect
our gross profit margin. If we are unable to offset declining prices through cost reductions or
product improvements, our profitability will be negatively impacted, which could materially
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

develop solutions or technologies on a more expedited basis than us or are successful in
developing solutions that are accepted more rapidly and broadly by the market than our
solutions, we could lose market share. Matching or surpassing technological advances that may
be developed by our competitors could require an extended period of time. In addition, our
solutions could become obsolete sooner than anticipated due to a rapid change in one or more
of the technologies related to our solutions or the reduced life cycles of consumer and
industrial products.

Even if we are able to develop new semiconductor solutions or iterate our existing
products and technologies and achieve design wins, we may initially experience lower
manufacturing yields from them than our other more established solutions, potentially affecting
our gross profit margin at least in the short term. These new solutions and technologies also
often have a higher cost structure than our existing solutions and technologies as we devote
more time and effort to their development, and our suppliers and manufacturers may incur
additional costs by acquiring new equipment or components in order to meet our design
specification and capacity requirements.

**We** **depend** **on** **third-party** **foundries,** **which** **reduces** **our ability** **to** **control** **our**
**manufacturing process. Any interruption or shortage or loss of capacity from these**
**foundries could materially interrupt our business operations and product offerings, and**
**a significant increase in procurement costs could also affect our gross profit margin.**

We adopt a fabless manufacturing strategy, where we focus on the design and sales of
memory chip and mixed-signal chip products and solutions and partner with world-leading
suppliers on wafer fabrication, packaging and testing. We have maintained long-standing
partnership with world-leading foundries with whom we work collaboratively to leverage their
facilities. We believe our fabless model reduces our capital requirements, operating expenses
and time to market, which in turn enables us to focus and devote our resources to developing
our core competencies in research and development, technological innovation, and product
design. Historically, we relied on a small number of foundries. See “Business — Our
Suppliers” for details of our top five suppliers that are third-party foundries.

We typically secure manufacturing capacity in any particular period on a purchase order
basis. The foundries generally have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific
period, in any specific quantity or at any specific price, except as set forth in a particular
purchase order. In general, our reliance on third-party foundries involves a number of
significant risks, including:

-  reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields
and production costs;

-  lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply;

-  unavailability of, or delayed access to, next generation or key process technologies;
and


-----

-  financial difficulties or disruptions in the operations of third-party foundries due to
causes beyond our control, including geopolitical uncertainties.

The size of the orders we place with the foundries depends on actual or anticipated sales
volumes of our products. Because our foundry partners also provide services to other
companies, in the event they receive increased orders from us or other companies that they
service, they may be unable to provide us with the requested quantity of supplies, may
subordinate our request to the requests of other companies or may increase the prices they
charge us. In recent years, the global semiconductor industry experienced supply chain
constraints, in particular, during the period when global supply chain volatility coincided with
surging demand. Notably, certain materials for producing a wafer are primarily available in a
limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade
disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, political conditions, or public health
issues may limit the foundries to obtain such materials. During each period of the Track Record
Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we had maintained a stable supply of wafers from
multiple semiconductor manufacturers, and expect to maintain such stable relationship for the
foreseeable future. During the Track Record Period, the wafer supply constraint had not had a
material impact on our business operations and financial performance. The wafer supply
constraint may force companies in the industry to take certain actions such as allocating
available products and solutions among customers or increasing the prices of products and
solutions. This could result in harm to customer relations, the loss of sales and, in some cases,
the loss of future business with those customers. If constraints in supply exist or if for any
reason our foundry partners are unable to provide a sufficient number of wafers to us on a
timely basis and at acceptable yields and costs, we may be unable to achieve future growth,
which could result in our revenue, gross profit margin and other financial results being
materially and adversely affected.

The current global economic and geopolitical conditions could materially affect our
foundry partners and cause them to be unable to provide necessary services to us. If any of our
foundry partners were unable to continue manufacturing our wafers in the required quantities,
at acceptable quality, yields and costs, or in a timely manner, we may have to identify and
qualify substitute foundries, which could be time consuming and difficult, and could negatively
impact our revenues in the short term as well as increase our costs or result in unforeseen
manufacturing problems. In addition, if competition for foundry capacity increases, we may be
required to pay higher prices for manufacturing services.

Meanwhile, our foundry partners may also be subject to upstream supply constraints. For
example, the raw materials used for wafer fabrication are subject to availability constraints and
price volatility caused by supply conditions, regulations, macroeconomic conditions and other
unpredictable factors. In the event that the raw materials our foundry partners acquire from
their upstream suppliers increase in price or reduce in availability, we may be required to
increase the prices we charge our customers, which could result in decreased sales, and we may
not successfully pass the increased costs to our customers, which could result in a loss or in
decreased profits.


-----

on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. These factors may cause unforeseen product
shortages or may increase our costs of manufacturing, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**We may be unable to adequately forecast demand for our semiconductor solutions due to**
**the unpredictability of the sales cycle. If we fail to manage our inventory effectively as a**
**result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be**
**materially and adversely affected.**

We generally have no long-term or minimum purchase commitments from our customers.
In addition, even when customers may not have the contractual right to cancel or reschedule
orders, it is customary business practice in the semiconductor industry for suppliers like us to
permit such cancellations or rescheduling in order to maintain good relationships with
customers or for other business reasons. As a result, we depend on our demand forecasts for
various kinds of solutions to make manufacturing decisions and to manage our inventory.
Demand for solutions, however, can change significantly between the time inventory is ordered
and the date by which we target to sell it. Demand may be affected by cyclicity, new product
launches, changes in product cycles and pricing, product defects, changes in customer
purchasing patterns with respect to our solutions and other factors, and our customers may not
order solutions in the quantities that we expect. In addition, when we begin selling a new
product, it may be difficult to establish supplier relationships, determine appropriate product
selection, and accurately forecast market demand.

Cancellations of, reductions in, or rescheduling of customer orders could also result in the
loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and
operating expenses, as a substantial portion of our expenses are fixed at least in the short term.

**Our performance is subject to fluctuations in demand from downstream industries that**
**adopt our products, the prices of the end products, and the timing of our new product**
**developments and iteration of our existing products.**

Our business strategy depends in large part on the continued growth of the downstream
markets into which we sell our semiconductor solutions, including consumer electronics,
automotive and various other markets. The timing of new product developments and iteration
of our existing products, the life-cycle of existing electronics products and the level of
acceptance and growth of new products can also affect demand for our products. If these
downstream markets do not grow and develop as we anticipate, or our customers fail to market
and sell their products as they anticipate in the verticals for reasons out of our control, we may
be unable to sustain or grow the sales of our solutions. In order to compete successfully, we
must design, develop, market and sell new or enhanced products that provide high levels of
performance and reliability, offer and integrate new functionalities and meet the cost
expectations of the markets. The cyclical nature of the growth of the downstream markets of
our semiconductor solutions could also adversely affect the demand of our solutions and our
ability to accurately forecast market demand, leading to fluctuations in our business, financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, our business and financial condition may be


-----

adversely affected if certain new verticals do not emerge or develop as expected. Securities

[REDACTED] may factor revenue from such new verticals into their future estimates of our
financial performance and should such verticals not develop as expected, such estimates, our
business and financial condition could be adversely affected.

The downstream markets are also subject to rapid technological change. In order to
compete successfully in these markets, we will have to correctly forecast customer demand for
technological improvements and be able to deliver such solutions on a timely basis at
competitive prices. If we fail to do so, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our solutions have also been and will
continue to be incorporated into other consumer and industrial applications. As our solutions
begin to fill a greater role in these other verticals, the challenges and risks that we face in these
other verticals could increase. If our sales to these markets do not increase and/or these
verticals do not grow as expected, our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

**A large portion of our revenue has been derived from a small number of customers. The**
**loss of, or significant reduction in the purchases by, one or more of such customers could**
**materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.**

Historically, our top five customers accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue. In
2023, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2025, approximately 57.7%, 57.5%, and
59.3%, respectively, of our revenue came from sales to our top five customers in the respective
periods. Any material delay, alteration, cancellation or reduction of purchase orders from or
change in the purchasing patterns of such customers, which may in turn be attributable to
changes in their respective customers’ demand and purchasing patterns, could have a material
and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be affected by
our ability to retain our existing customers and to attract new customers, as well as on the
financial condition and success of our customers, including their ability to retain their
respective customers and attract new customers. Furthermore, our major customers may have
substantial bargaining power and leverage when negotiating contractual arrangements with us.
Such customers have and may continue to seek advantageous pricing and other commercial
terms and may require us, from time to time, to develop additional features in the solutions we
sell to them. As a result, we may have to reduce the average selling price and/or incur increased
average cost of our solutions, which may have a negative impact on our gross profit margin.
If we are unable to retain one or more of our major customers, or if we are unable to maintain
our current level of revenue and gross profits from such customers, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be impaired.


-----

**Our distributorship model increases the complexity of our business.**

In line with the market practice, we use distributors to facilitate our sales. These
distributors also assume responsibility for customer support. Revenues from sales of our
products and solutions to our distributors represented approximately 68.7%, 54.0%, and 48.2%
of our revenues in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2025, respectively. We expect that distribution will continue to represent a
significant proportion of our total revenue, although they may vary from year to year. Indirect
distribution introduces a number of operational and financial complexities, and our ability to
manage these relationships effectively is critical to maintaining stable cash flows, and healthy
gross margins.

Distributorship model increases the complexity of our business and may require us to,
among other matters:

-  manage a more complex sales network;

-  negotiate credit terms, return policies and pricing with our distributor;

-  evaluate the impact of credit terms, return policies, pricing and unsold inventory
associated with each distributor; and

-  assess the financial condition and creditworthiness of our distributors.

Any failure to manage these challenges could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. In particular, failure to implement robust distributor
management systems and controls — such as real-time inventory tracking, regular audits,
contract enforcement, and financial monitoring — could result in inaccurate revenue forecasts,
excess or obsolete inventory, write-downs, unexpected returns, or even legal disputes. Any
deterioration, termination or material change in our relationships with our distributors could
adversely affect our sales channels and market coverage. These outcomes could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price
performance.


-----

**Our success depends on our ability to maintain close relationships with our customers and**
**to convince our current and prospective customers to adopt our semiconductor solutions**
**into their product offerings.**

Our success has been, and will continue to be, dependent upon manufacturers and their
customers designing our semiconductor solutions into their products. To achieve design wins,
which are decisions by manufacturers and their customers to design our solutions into their
systems, we must define and deliver cost effective and innovative semiconductor solutions on
a timely basis that satisfy the manufacturers’ and their customers’ requirements and
specifications. Our ability to achieve design wins is subject to numerous risks including
competition from other solutions, the compatibility of our solutions with newly developed
technologies or designs used in the end products, as well as delays in our product development
cycle. Even if our solutions meet our customers’ requirements and specifications, we may not
eventually succeed in achieving a particular design win due to factors out of our control, such
as the customers’ pre-existing relationship with a particular supplier or other business
considerations. If we do not achieve a design win with a prospective customer, it may be
difficult to sell our semiconductor solutions to such prospective customer in the future because
once a manufacturer has designed a supplier’s solutions into its systems, it may be reluctant
to change its source of components due to the significant costs, time, efforts and risks
associated with qualifying a new supplier and, in many cases, modifying its design platforms.
In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to achieve design wins with
customers with whom we have achieved design wins in the past. As our customers take on new
projects, there is no obligation on their part to continue to design our solutions into their
product offerings. Accordingly, if we fail to achieve design wins with key customers that
embed semiconductors in their products, our market share or revenue could be adversely
affected. Furthermore, to the extent that our competitors secure design wins, our ability to grow
our business in the future will be impaired.

In addition, the selection process for semiconductors to be included in our customers’
product offerings is typically lengthy and may require us to incur design and research and
development expenditures and dedicate scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single
design win with no assurance that our solutions will be selected. Because of our extended
product life cycle, our revenue in future years is highly dependent on design wins we are
awarded in prior years. It is possible that a design win will not result in meaningful revenue
until one year or more or later, or at all. If we do not continue to achieve design wins, our
revenue in the following years may deteriorate. As a result, the loss of any key design win or
any significant delay in the production of the customer’s products into which our product is
designed could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

enhancements will conform to the then prevailing industry standards under all circumstances.
If our solutions do not conform to, or are not compatible with, existing or emerging standards,
our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected.

**Our lengthy and complex product cycle including designing, taping-out, fabricating,**
**packaging and testing, in addition to our customers’ qualification and design cycle, may**
**result in uncertainty and delays in revenue generation.**

The production of our designs requires a lengthy manufacturing and packaging process.
Additional time may pass before a customer commences taking volume shipments of products
that incorporate our solutions. Even when a manufacturer agrees to design our solutions into
its products, it may not deliver final products incorporating our semiconductor solutions. See
also “— Our customers and/or end customers may require our semiconductor solutions to
undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification and verification process. If we are unsuccessful
in or delayed in qualifying any of our semiconductor solutions with a customer, our business,
financial condition and results of operations could suffer.”

Given this lengthy cycle described above, we may experience a delay between the time
we incur expenditures for research and development and sales and marketing efforts and the
time we generate revenue, if any, from these expenditures. This lengthy cycle makes it more
difficult to forecast customer demand, which adds uncertainty to the manufacturing planning
process and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the product life cycle for certain of our semiconductor solutions designed for use
in certain applications can be relatively short. If we fail to appropriately manage the
manufacturing and packaging process, our solutions may become obsolete before they can be
incorporated into our customers’ products and we may never realize a return on investment for
the expenditures we incur in designing, developing and producing these solutions.

**Quality control and reliability is especially critical in the semiconductor industry, and any**
**product defects, delays in delivery and adverse performance reliability could negatively**
**affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and may expose us to**
**contractual liabilities, litigation risks and regulatory actions.**

Our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality, performance, and
reliability that our solutions are required to meet. Our solutions based upon evolving
technologies are highly complex. The integration of additional functions into already complex
solutions could result in a greater risk that customers or end-users could discover latent defects
after we have already shipped significant quantities of a product, which might require product
replacement or recall. Defective products can be caused by design, defective materials or
component parts, or manufacturing difficulties. In particular, our third-party manufacturing
processes or changes thereof, including raw material used in the manufacturing processes, may
cause delays in production or cause our products to malfunction or fail. For example, minute
levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the wafer fabrication


-----

process or other factors can cause a portion of the components on a wafer to be non-functional.
These problems may be difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and
are often time-consuming and expensive to correct.

We may from time to time encounter product quality, performance and reliability issues.
Delivery of products with defects or reliability, quality or compatibility problems may damage
our reputation and ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. If defects and
failures occur in our products, we could experience lost revenue, increased costs, including
warranty expense and costs associated with customer support, cancellations or rescheduling of
orders or shipments, and product returns or discounts, any of which could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations. We may also face litigation and regulatory actions
in relation to our product defects and failures. See “— If we become subject to litigation, legal
or contractual disputes, governmental investigations or administrative proceedings, our
management’s attention may be diverted and we may incur substantial costs and liabilities.”

Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that we will always achieve acceptable yields at
third-party foundries, which may result in delays in the availability of components. Moreover,
an increase in the rejection rate of these components, or our solutions incorporating them,
during the quality control process before, during or after the manufacturing process may result
in lower yields and margin, as well as disruptions to our delivery schedule.

In addition, changes in manufacturing processes required as a result of changes in product
specifications, changing customer needs and the introduction of new business lines may
significantly reduce manufacturing yields, potentially affecting our gross profit margin at least
in the short term. Poor manufacturing yields over a prolonged period of time could adversely
affect our ability to deliver solutions on a timely basis, increase our gross profit margin, and
maintain a stable relationship with our customers, which could materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Our customers and/or end customers may require our semiconductor solutions to undergo**
**a lengthy and expensive qualification and verification process. If we are unsuccessful in**
**or delayed in qualifying any of our semiconductor solutions with a customer, our business,**
**financial condition and results of operations could suffer.**

Prior to purchasing our solutions, our customers and/or end customers require that our
solutions undergo extensive qualification processes, which involve testing of our solutions in
the customers’ systems, as well as testing for reliability. This qualification process may
continue for several months. After our solutions are qualified, it can take several months or
more before the customer commences mass production of components or systems that
incorporate our solutions.

Moreover, qualification of a product by a customer does not assure final sales of the
product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a
customer, a subsequent revision in our foundry partners’ manufacturing process or our
selection of a new supplier may require a new qualification process with our customers, which


-----

may result in delays and our holding excess or obsolete inventory. If we are unsuccessful or
delayed in qualifying any of our solutions with a customer, sales of those solutions to the
customer may be precluded or delayed, which may harm our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**We may not be able to deepen our presence or increase our market share in target markets**
**successfully. If we fail to expand our operations in target markets as expected, our growth**
**could be adversely affected.**

Our growth will be dependent upon, among other things, our ability to analyze correctly
the conditions of our target markets we intend to penetrate, adapt to the business environment
of the changing market conditions and conclude successful negotiation with potential business
partners. If we fail to adapt to the business environment and conditions of these markets or fail
to provide products matching demands of these markets, or the economies of the markets suffer
any downturn, or there is any tension between the economies and where we mainly operate, or
there is any fluctuation in currency exchange rates or unexpected changes in regulatory
requirements of markets, or any of the business arrangements in which we are a party are not
successful, our operation and financial performance will be materially adversely affected.

**Strategic alliances, investments, acquisitions and divestures may affect our business,**
**financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to achieve our**
**anticipated benefits and synergistic effects from such alliances, investments and**
**acquisitions.**

We may enter into strategic alliances with various third parties, such as our key customers
and suppliers, to facilitate the implementation of our business strategies from time to time.
Strategic alliances with third parties could subject us to a number of risks, including risks
associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance by the counterparty, and an
increase in expenses incurred in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may
materially and adversely affect our business. We may have little ability to control or monitor
such third parties’ actions. To the extent the third parties suffer negative publicity or harm to
their reputations from events relating to their business, we may also suffer negative publicity
or harm to our reputation by virtue of our association with such third parties.

In addition, we have in the past invested in additional assets, technologies or businesses
that are complementary to our existing business. For example, we made investments in an IC
design and sales company in 2023 and 2024, which has enhanced our technological capabilities
and synergies across our business lines. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide
array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including
potential acquisitions of businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets, as well
as strategic investments, joint ventures and alliances.


-----

Investments or acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses
into our own would require attention from our management and could result in a diversion of
resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our
business operations. The costs of identifying and consummating investments and acquisitions
may be significant. We may also incur expenses in obtaining necessary approvals from relevant
local government authorities. In addition, investments and acquisitions could result in the use
of substantial amounts of cash, dilution of our stock prices due to share issuances and exposure
to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business. The cost and duration of integrating
newly acquired businesses could also materially exceed our expectations. We may also face
challenges in international acquisitions, such as compliance with local law and regulation,
limited access to target companies and cultural assimilation challenges. Such investments or
acquisitions may fail to deliver the anticipated strategic or financial benefits, including cost
savings, revenue growth, or technological advancements. Any such negative developments
could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

From time to time, we may also divest under-performing businesses, or businesses that no
longer fit our overall strategy. Such divestitures may have a negative impact on our financial
performance for the relevant period.

Other risks associated with strategic alliances, investments, acquisitions and divestures
include:

-  difficulty in realizing the potential technological benefits of the transaction;

-  problems related to integrating the acquired key employees, operations,
technologies or products into our existing business and semiconductor solutions, and
to divesting under-performing businesses from us;

-  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;

-  adverse effects on existing business relationships with employees, customers,
suppliers and strategic partners as a result of integration of new businesses and
management personnel;

-  risks associated with entering markets in which we lack experience; and

-  negative publicity, litigation, government inquiries, investigations or actions against
the companies we invest in or acquire, or even against our other businesses.

Our failure to address these risks successfully could have a material and adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**We may not be able to sustain our historical growth rates or effectively implement our**
**business strategies and expansion plans. If we do not successfully manage our growth, our**
**ability to increase our revenue and improve our earnings could be adversely affected.**

We have experienced rapid growth in recent years. Our revenue increased from
RMB769.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to RMB932.8 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2025 and from RMB703.5 million in 2023 to RMB1,028.3
million in 2024. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical
growth rates in future periods. Our revenue growth may slow or our revenue may decline for
any number of possible reasons, such as decreased customer orders, increased competition,
slowdown in the growth or contraction of the semiconductor industry, changes in policies or
general economic conditions, and natural disasters or outbreaks of pandemics. If our growth
rate declines, [REDACTED] perceptions of our business and business prospects may be
adversely affected and the [REDACTED] of our ordinary shares and H Shares could decline.

We plan to achieve our business growth by implementing a series of strategies, such as
maintaining technology leadership and developing leading, feature-rich solutions, further
increasing market share and penetrating our addressable markets, innovating our applicationspecific technologies to expand into new verticals, and continuing to strengthen global
ecosystem through partnerships and supply chain optimization. There is no assurance that we
will be able to implement our business strategies and expansion plans successfully, which in
turn are subject to uncertainties and changing market conditions. Our plans for development
and business expansion are formulated based on assumptions on the occurrence of certain
future events, which may or may not materialize. We may encounter difficulties in
implementing our business strategies such as failing to further expand our operations due to
intense competition in the semiconductor industry and the new regulations in the
semiconductor industry that we may not be familiar with. We may also not have timely access
to adequate capital financing when suitable business opportunities arise. Further, there is also
no assurance that any of our business strategies will yield the benefits or achieve the level of
profitability we anticipate.

To manage our growth effectively, we must, among other things:

-  solidify our technology barriers and continuously enhance ability to innovate;

-  continuously monitor market trends in real time and update our products
accordingly;

-  continuously improve our operational, financial and accounting systems;

-  train, manage and maintain good relations with our existing employee base;

-  continue to broaden our market presence by expanding into new markets, customers
and sales channels;

-  attract and retain qualified personnel with relevant experience;

-  effectively manage trade receivables and inventory; and


-----

-  navigate evolving trade and investment policies — both domestically and
internationally — that may impact our supply chain, market access, investment
strategy, and overall business operations.

We must also manage multiple relationships with customers, business partners and other
third parties, such as our foundry partners and packaging service providers. Moreover, future
growth could significantly overburden our management and financial systems and other
resources. We may not make adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with our
expansion. In addition, our systems, procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our
operations, and we may not be able to expand quickly enough to capitalize on potential market
opportunities. Our future results of operations will also depend, in part, on our ability to
expand sales and marketing, research and development, accounting, finance and administrative
support.

**Our future results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance or fail to meet**
**expectations as a result of conditions beyond our control, such as general economic**
**conditions in the overseas and domestic markets, cyclical and other market conditions**
**within our industry and the financial health and viability of our suppliers and customers.**

Our results may fluctuate in the future, may fail to match our past performance or fail to
meet our expectations and the expectations of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] as a result
of conditions beyond our control. Our results and related ratios, such as gross profit margin,
operating profit margin and effective tax rate may fluctuate for a variety of reasons beyond our
control, including:

-  general economic and political conditions in the countries and regions where we sell
our semiconductor solutions;

-  the timing of new product introductions by our customers and our competitors;

-  cyclicity and variability in downstream markets;

-  movements in exchange rates, which can impact our reported revenues, cost of
goods sold, and profitability, especially given that we operate across multiple
jurisdictions and transact in various currencies;

-  unexpected changes in the manufacturing and delivery capabilities of our foundry
partners and packaging service providers;

-  imposition of additional trade and investment restrictions, tariffs, export controls, or
sanctions that could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, limit our access to
key markets, or constrain our ability to invest in or collaborate with certain
technologies or jurisdictions; and

**Our business depends on the proper functioning of internal processes and information**
**technology systems. A failure of these processes and systems, data breaches, cyber-attacks,**
**or cyber-fraud may cause business disruptions, compromise our intellectual property or**
**other sensitive information, litigation or government actions, or result in losses.**

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology
applications, systems and networks to operate our business. The reliability and security of
information technology infrastructure and software, and our ability to expand and continually
update technologies in response to changing needs is critical to our business. Any significant
interruption in these applications, systems or networks, including new system implementations,
computer viruses, cyberattacks, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts, could
have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Cyber-attacks attempting to obtain access to our computer systems and networks could
result in the misappropriation of proprietary information and technology. There can be no
assurance that a future breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and
financial results. In the current environment, there are numerous and evolving risks to
cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial
espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. In the event of such
breaches, we, our customers or other third parties could be exposed to potential liability,
litigation, and regulatory action, as well as the potential loss of existing or potential customers,
damage to reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational
consequences of responding to attempted breaches and implementing remediation measures
could be significant.

Cyber-attacks or other catastrophic events could result in interruptions or delays to us, our
customers, or other third-party operations or services, financial loss, potential liability, and
damage our reputation and affect our relationships with customers and suppliers. Further, we
may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal and confidential data regarding our
employees, customers and suppliers that is routinely collected, used, stored, and transferred to
run our business. Such theft, loss, or misuse could result in significantly increased business and
security costs or costs related to defending legal claims.

Our business also depends on various outsourced IT services. We rely on third-party
vendors to provide critical services and to adequately address cyber security threats to their
own systems. Any material failure of third-party systems and services to operate effectively
could disrupt our operations and could have a material and adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**Actual or alleged failure to comply with privacy and data protection laws and regulations**
**could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers from using our**
**solutions and subject us to legal, financial and operational consequences.**

We collect and store business and transaction data generated during or related to our
operations, including records of interactions and transactions with customers, suppliers, and
business partners. The secure storage and maintenance of such data are critically important. We
process this data in compliance with applicable legal requirements to ensure its security. We
have adopted various measures to ensure legal compliance. See “Business — Data Privacy and
Information Security Risk Management” for more information. However, the laws and
regulations regarding privacy and data protection are generally complex and still evolving and
changing. As such, we cannot assure you that our privacy and data protection measures are, and
will be, always considered sufficient under applicable laws and regulations. Material changes
in these laws and regulations could result in increased costs on us in order to maintain
compliance, to meet the demands of our customers relating to their own compliance with
applicable laws and regulations and to establish and maintain internal compliance policies. The
legal and regulatory developments with respect to data protection may also affect how we
design our IT systems, how we and our business partners process data, which in turn could
affect demand for our products. Additionally, the effectiveness of our privacy and data
protection measures is also subject to system failure, interruption, inadequacy, or security
breaches. If we are unable to comply with the then-applicable laws and regulations, or to
address any privacy and data protection concerns, such actual or alleged failure could damage
our reputation, deter current and potential customers from using our solutions and could
subject us to adverse legal, financial and operational consequences.

**Our insurance coverage may not completely cover the risks related to our business and**
**operations.**

We maintain insurance policies that are required under the laws and administrative
regulations of the jurisdiction where we operate as well as based on our assessment of our
operational needs and industry practice. We maintain insurance policies on our buildings,
equipment and inventories covering property damage and damage due to, among other events,
fires, typhoons, earthquakes and floods. We maintain these insurance policies on our facilities
and have arranged open cover insurance for import and export cargo transportation and
domestic cargo transportation. We also maintain property insurance for our operations.
Additionally, although we intend to purchase director and officer liability insurance for our
directors and senior management, we currently do not maintain director and officer liability
insurance. In compliance with the applicable PRC laws and regulations, we also provide social
security insurance including pension insurance, unemployment insurance, work-related injury
insurance, maternity insurance and medical insurance to our employees. In addition, we also
provide certain types of commercial insurance to our employees. We do not have insurance for
business interruptions, nor do we maintain product liability insurance or key person insurance.
We cannot assure you that our insurance coverage is sufficient to cover all of our risk exposure
and prevent us from any loss, or that we will be able to successfully claim our losses under our
current insurance policies on a timely basis, or at all. If we incur any loss that is not covered


-----

by our insurance policies, or if the compensated amount is significantly less than our actual
loss, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected. Any liability or damage to, or caused by, our facilities or our personnel
beyond our insurance coverage may result in our incurring substantial costs and a diversion of
resources.

**Failure to renew our leases or to comply with PRC property-related laws and regulations**
**regarding certain of our leased properties could adversely affect our business.**

As of the Latest Practicable Date, we held nine leased properties in China which are
primarily used as offices and warehouses. We generally enter into long-term lease agreements
with our lessors. However, there can be no assurance that we would be able to renew the
relevant lease agreements at reasonable cost, or at all; if we fail to do so, we may be compelled
to relocate from the affected premises. Such relocation may result in additional expenses or
business interruption, or we may not be able to find suitable alternatives in a timely manner,
or at all, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

As of the Latest Practicable Date, we had not completed lease registration for such nine
leased properties. As advised by our PRC Legal Advisor, failure to register such lease
agreements as required by the relevant competent authorities may subject us to a fine of
RMB1,000 to RMB10,000 for each unregistered lease agreement. See “Business —
Properties.” If we are challenged by government authorities in connection with our use of the
foregoing leased properties, we may be subject to fines and, as a result, our business, results
of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

**Our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to protect, maintain or enforce our**
**intellectual property rights adequately. Our patents, trade secrets, know-how and other**
**proprietary information may be stolen, used in an unauthorized manner, or compromised,**
**which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition,**
**business and prospects.**

We believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is, and will continue to
be, important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secret
protection, non-disclosure and other contractual agreements and trademarks to establish and
protect our proprietary intellectual property rights. Our inability to adequately protect our
intellectual property rights could materially and adversely affect our competitive position,
business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

-  obtaining from the holder of the infringed intellectual property a license to sell or
use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on acceptable terms,
if at all; or

-  redesigning those products or services that incorporate the disputed intellectual
property, which could result in substantial unanticipated development expenses and
delay and prevent us from selling the solutions until the redesign is completed, if at
all.

If we are subject to a successful claim of infringement and we fail to develop
non-infringing intellectual property or license the infringed intellectual property on acceptable
terms and on a timely basis, we may be unable to sell some or all of our solutions, and our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may in
the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual
property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the
proprietary rights of competitors. These claims could also result in significant expense and the
diversion of technical and management attention.

In addition, third parties may assert claims of infringement and misappropriation of
proprietary rights based on the use or resale of our solutions against our business partners with
whom we do business. In addition, the end customers may also be named as parties in these
claims. Under our agreements with certain suppliers and customers, we may be required to
defend protracted and costly litigation on their behalf, regardless of the merits of these claims,
or to indemnify these parties for such claims. If we are required or agree to defend or indemnify
any of our suppliers, customers or their end customers in connection with any claims of
infringement or misappropriation of proprietary rights or injunctions are secured by third
parties that prevent the sale of products that incorporate our solutions, we could incur
significant costs and expenses and experience a significant decrease in our revenue that could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Our ability to design, introduce and sell our semiconductor solutions is dependent in part**
**upon third-party intellectual property rights.**

In the design and development of new semiconductor solutions, product enhancements
and sales of current solutions, we rely in part on third-party intellectual properties such as
development tools and testing tools. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on
intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet
future customer demands for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor
solutions may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development
tools that are available to us. In addition, hardware and software tools and products procured
or licensed from third parties may contain design or manufacturing defects that such third
parties are unable to resolve, including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the
operation of our solutions. Furthermore, some of the software licensed from third parties may
not be available in the future on terms acceptable to us or allow our solutions to remain
competitive. The loss of these licenses or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially


-----

acceptable terms could delay development of future solutions or the enhancement of existing
solutions. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable or fails to
produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be harmed.

**The intellectual property laws of different jurisdictions may differ and we may not be able**
**to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions.**

Our international operation requires us to seek protection of our intellectual property in
various jurisdictions including China, Hong Kong, the United States or other countries or
regions in which we operate, relying on a combination of trade secrets and regulatory
protection methods. As of the Latest Practicable Date, we owned 76 patents, nine software
copyrights, and 78 composition designs around the globe. The issuance, scope, validity and
enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights are highly uncertain and
differ significantly in different jurisdictions. For example, filing and prosecuting patent
applications and defending patents covering our technologies in all countries across the world
could be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions in
which we have not obtained sufficient intellectual property protection and may subsequently
export otherwise infringing solutions to territories where we have intellectual property
protection, taking advantage of the varying levels of law enforcement across jurisdictions.
Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our significant
markets, there can be no assurance that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts
in all jurisdictions in which we may expect to expand our business.

In addition, the laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the
same extent as the laws or rules and regulations in certain other jurisdictions, and many
companies have encountered significant difficulties in registering, protecting and defending
such rights in certain jurisdictions. Furthermore, the legal systems of certain countries,
particularly developing countries, may not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and
other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the
infringement of our patents or the sales and marketing of competing solutions in violation of
our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in different
jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts
and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being
invalidated or interpreted narrowly, and our patent applications at risk of not issuing as patents,
and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits
that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially
meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries
may be inadequate, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.


-----

**Our patent applications may not be issued as patents, which may have a material adverse**
**effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting solutions similar to**
**ours.**

We cannot be certain that we are the first inventor of the subject matter for which we have
filed a particular patent application, or if we are the first party to file such a patent application.
If another party has filed a patent application covering the same subject matter as we have
developed, and such application has priority against our patent application, we may not be
entitled to the protection sought by our patent application, including preventing third parties
from commercializing the same or similar technologies. Further, the scope of protection of
patent claims may be limited or narrowed if the examining authority determines there is cause
to do so, such as if claims included in the patent application cover subject matter that is
ineligible for patent protection or is obvious, or are deemed to lack sufficient detail to enable
practicing the invention or in the event of the existence of prior art. As a result, we cannot be
certain that the patent applications that we file will result in issued patents, or that our issued
patents will be broad enough to protect our technology or otherwise afford protection against
competitors with similar technology. In addition, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as
to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability. Our competitors may challenge or seek to
invalidate our issued patents, or design around our issued patents, which may adversely affect
our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results. Also, the costs associated with
enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements, or other intellectual property
rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable.

**Changes in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing**
**our ability to protect our solutions.**

The scope of patent protection in various jurisdictions is uncertain. Changes in either the
patent laws or their interpretation in China or other countries may diminish our ability to
protect our inventions, obtain, maintain, defend, and enforce our intellectual property rights
and, more generally, could affect the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of
our patent rights. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing
and may pursue in the future will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the
claims of any future granted patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors. The
coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is
issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Even if patent applications that we
own currently or in the future issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide
us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing
with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. As a result, the issuance,
scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.


-----

a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, certain of our Directors may be subject to alleged class actions due to
their current or previous directorships in other listed companies. Our Directors and executive
officers may also face litigation or proceedings (including alleged or future securities class
action) unrelated to their respective capacity as a Director or executive officer of our company,
and such litigation or proceedings may adversely affect our public image and reputation.

**We operate in accordance with environmental, occupational health and safety and other**
**similar laws and regulations, which may involve modifying our activities or incurring**
**substantial costs, and such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial costs,**
**liabilities, obligations and fines, or require it to have suppliers alter their processes.**

The semiconductor industry is subject to a variety of international and domestic laws and
regulations governing pollution, environmental protection and occupational health and safety.
As a fabless company, we are focused on the design and sales of our products while
outsourcing the manufacturing process, however, compliance with current or future
environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations could restrict our ability
to expand our business or require us to modify processes or incur other substantial expenses
which could harm our business. Environmental and occupational health and safety laws and
regulations have tended to become more stringent over time, causing a need to redesign
technologies, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated
with violations, which could seriously harm our business.

**Our compliance and risk management systems may not be sufficient to protect us from**
**credit, market, liquidity, operation and other risks.**

We have business relationship with clients from countries around the world, including in
countries with a strong commitment to anti-corruption and ethical behavior. We have
established compliance and risk management systems that support our operational business
processes to comply with laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our
compliance and risk management systems are adequate to address all applicable risks in every
jurisdiction. We are subject to the risk that we, our employees or any third-parties that we
engage to do work on our behalf in certain countries may take action determined to be in
violation of anti-corruption laws in any jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Corruption
can result in huge economic losses due to fraud, theft and waste. Moreover, corruption can
corrode critical public institutions, such as the courts, law enforcement and public pension
administration, thereby undermining property rights, public confidence and social stability. As
a result, corruption dramatically increases the systemic risks that exist in some of the
jurisdictions in which we operate. We are thus exposed to the increased costs and risks of
corruption where we operate, and there can be no assurance that any reform efforts will have
a meaningful effect during our term. The United States has the FCPA, and other jurisdictions
have adopted similar anti-corruption laws. Many of these laws have extraterritorial application.
In addition, we will have internal ethics policies that we require our employees to comply with
in order to ensure that our business is conducted in a manner that our management deems
appropriate. If these anti-corruption laws or internal policies were to be violated, our reputation
and operations could also be substantially harmed.


-----

In recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice has devoted greater resources to
enforcement of the FCPA. Other countries have also adopted or improved their anti-corruption
legal regimes in recent years. We are committed, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, to complying with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, anti-bribery
laws and regulations, as well as anti-boycott regulations to which they/we are subject. As a
result, we could be adversely affected because of our unwillingness to participate in
transactions that violate such laws or regulations. Such laws and regulations can make it
difficult in certain circumstances for us to act successfully on investment opportunities or to
obtain or retain business.

Any violation of the FCPA or any similar anti-corruption law or regulation could result
in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in
certain jurisdictions and might adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, we will have internal ethics policies that we require our employees to
comply with in order to ensure that our business is conducted in a manner that our management
deems appropriate. If these anti-corruption laws or internal policies were to be violated, our
reputation and operations could also be substantially harmed. In addition, we could incur costs
and expenses associated with engaging external counsel or other third-party consultants or
professionals in connection with inquiries or investigations relating to FCPA or other
applicable anti-corruption laws or anti-bribery laws. In these cases, we could suffer significant
losses from the cost of defense, interruption to ordinary operations and fines and penalties.

**Non-compliance on the part of our business partners or other third parties involved in our**
**business could adversely affect our business.**

We are exposed to the risk of non-compliance or improper conduct by our business
partners or other third parties. Our business partners, as well as other third parties who entered
into business relationships with us, may also be subject to regulatory penalties or punishments
because of their regulatory non-compliance, which may, directly or indirectly, disrupt our
business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify irregularities or noncompliances in the business practices of our business partners or other third parties, or that
such irregularities or non-compliance will be corrected in a prompt and proper manner, or at
all.

If any governmental investigations, lawsuits or other actions are instituted against us as
a result of the actual or alleged illegal or improper activities by our business partners, or other
third parties involved in our business, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or
asserting our rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant civil, criminal
and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, monetary fines,
individual imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, contractual damages, reputational harm,
diminished profits and future earnings, which could have a significant impact on our business.
Whether or not we are successful in defending against such actions or investigations, we could
incur substantial costs, including legal fees and divert the attention of management in
defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations.


-----

**Any negative publicity with respect to us, the industry we are in or our business partners**
**may materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and**
**results of operations.**

We believe that our corporate reputation plays an increasingly important role in
enhancing our competitiveness in the semiconductor industry and maintaining our business
growth. Our ability to manage our corporate reputation depends on whether we could
successfully provide innovative and reliable products to our customers. Many other factors,
some of which are beyond our control, may negatively impact our corporate reputation if not
properly managed. Product quality issues, actual or perceived, even when false or unfounded,
could tarnish the image of our brand. In addition, we, our shareholders, Directors, senior
management, employees and business partners may be subject to negative media coverage and
publicity from time to time. Such negative coverage in the media and publicity could threaten
the perception of our reputation. As a result, we may be required to spend significant time and
incur substantial costs in response to allegations and negative publicity, and may not be able
to diffuse them to the satisfaction of our [REDACTED] and customers.

**We face risks associated with inventory impairments if we are unable to sell our products**
**in a timely manner or market conditions change.**

As of December 31, 2023, 2024 and September 30, 2025, we had inventories of
RMB225.2 million, RMB243.4 million and RMB274.8 million, respectively. As we plan to
continue expanding our business scale, we may increase our inventory level, which will make
it more challenging for us to manage our inventory effectively and will put more pressure on
our warehousing system. To weather the impact of rising manufacturing costs and tightening
supplies, we may strategically raise our inventory level from time to time, which can cause
potential liquidity constraint to our operating cash flow and expose us to greater risk of
negative price fluctuations. During the Track Record Period, we recorded write-down of
inventories to net realizable value due to the lower estimated realizable value of our inventories
than their costs. We recorded write-down of inventories to net realizable value of RMB7.6
million in 2023, RMB17.0 million in 2024, RMB32.7 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2025, respectively. If we fail to manage our inventory effectively, we may be
subject to a heightened risk of inventory obsolescence, a decline in inventory values, and
significant inventory write-downs or write-offs. In addition, we may be required to lower sale
prices in order to reduce inventory level, which may lead to lower gross profit margin. High
inventory levels may also require us to commit substantial capital resources, preventing us
from using that capital for other important purposes. On the other hand, if we underestimate
the demand for our products and solutions, or if our foundry partners fail to supply quality
wafers in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which might result in
missed sales, diminished brand loyalty and lost revenue. Any of the above may materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**We have granted, and may continue to grant, restricted shares and other types of awards**
**under our share incentive plans, which may result in increased equity-settled share-based**
**payments.**

We have adopted share incentive plans to provide additional incentives to employees and
Directors. We recorded RMB44.6 million, RMB29.3 million and RMB12.0 million in
equity-settled share-based payments for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024 and for
the nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. We believe the granting of
share-based awards is of significant importance to our ability to attract and retain key
personnel and employees, and we will continue to grant share-based awards to employees in
the future. As a result, our expenses associated with share-based payments may increase, which
may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

**Our business is subject to cyclical fluctuations which may in turn cause fluctuations in our**
**results of operations and cash flows from period to period.**

Our results of operations were subject to cyclicity in the past due to a number of factors,
many of which are beyond our control. These factors and other industry risks, many of which
are more fully discussed in our other risk factors, include:

-  the cyclical nature of the growth of end markets and customer demand for our
solutions;

-  our gain or loss of a large customer, or cutbacks in orders from such customers;

-  competitive pricing pressures;

-  our ability to achieve design wins;

-  the availability of production capacity at our foundry partners;

-  the growth of the market for semiconductor solutions and applications using
semiconductor solutions;

-  the deferral of customer orders in anticipation of new solutions, product designs or
enhancements; and

-  adverse changes in domestic or global economic conditions.

We also anticipate that the rate of orders from our customers may vary significantly from
period to period, while our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short-term.
Consequently, if we do not achieve the revenue we expect in any period, expenses and
inventory levels could be disproportionately high, adversely impacting our results of
operations and cash flows for that period, and potentially in future periods.

All of these factors are difficult to forecast and could result in fluctuations in our results
of operations. Fluctuations in our results of operations could adversely affect our share price
in a manner unrelated to our long-term operating performance.


-----

**Our future tax rates and tax payments could be higher than we anticipate and may harm**
**our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we are subject to risks**
**associated with changes in the preferential tax treatment applicable to us and certain of**
**our subsidiaries.**

We conduct our business in multiple countries and are subject to taxation in multiple
jurisdictions. The taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and
sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations. The application of tax law is subject to legal
and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. A number of other factors will also affect
our future tax rate, and some of these factors could increase our effective tax rate in future
periods, which could adversely impact our results of operations. These factors include changes
in non-deductible share-based payments, changes in the proportion and geographic mix of our
revenue or earnings, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes
in available tax credits, and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits.

Furthermore, local tax laws and regulations have provided certain preferential tax
treatments applicable to different enterprises, industries and locations. We and some of our
subsidiaries are currently taxed at preferential rates due to the nature of our business activities
and/or the location of our operations. For example, we enjoy a preferential income tax of 10%
due to our qualifications as a “Key Integrated Circuit Design Enterprises and Software
Enterprise.” Any change or elimination of such preferential tax treatments may materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 12 to the
Accountants’ Report set out in Appendix I to this document for details on the tax expenses we
accrued and tax rates we were subject to during the Track Record Period.

**If we need additional capital in the future, it may not be available to us on favorable**
**terms, or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds depends on a variety of factors,**
**including our credit ratings and anticipated results of operations.**

Our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments primarily come from cash provided
by operating activities. Although we currently expect our available cash, cash equivalents and
short term investments, together with cash we anticipate generating from operating activities,
will be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future, if we are unable
to sell our inventories or collect on our trade receivables as anticipated, we may be required
to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing. Such additional financing may not
be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and could have a material and adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If we raise additional funds
through issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into
equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership
and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those
of holders of our common shares. We are also subject to credit rating by third-party agencies,
any decline in credit ratings could increase our financing cost, affect our ability to raise
additional capital, and in turn have a material and adverse effect on the future growth of our
business.


-----

**The strategic priorities and financial performance of many of our businesses are subject**
**to the market and other dynamics related to carbon neutrality and ESG, which can pose**
**risks in addition to opportunities.**

There is an increasing focus from certain [REDACTED], customers and other parties in
society concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to ESG factors. Accordingly,
there is an increased emphasis on corporate responsibility ratings and a number of third parties
provide reports on companies in order to measure and assess ESG performance, which pose
reputational, regulatory and other risks on us. We believe that it is our responsibility to devote
substantial time and resources to develop technology and products designed to reduce carbon
footprint. In the meantime, given the nature of our businesses and the industries we serve, we
must anticipate and respond to market, technological, regulatory and other changes driven by
broader trends related to decarbonization efforts in response to climate change, and these
changes present both risks and opportunities for our businesses. The process of developing new
technology products and enhancing existing products to mitigate climate change is often
complex, costly and uncertain, and we may pursue strategies or make investments that do not
prove to be commercially successful in the time frames expected, or at all, which could impact
our operating results and financial conditions. Furthermore, our success in advancing
decarbonization objectives across our businesses will depend in part on the actions of
governments, regulators and other market participants to invest in infrastructure, create
appropriate market incentives and to otherwise support the development of new technologies.

In addition, the ESG factors by which companies’ corporate responsibility practices are
assessed may change, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to
undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. Alternatively, if we are unable to
satisfy such new criteria or we are unable to respond or perceived to be inadequately
responding to sustainability concerns, [REDACTED] may conclude that our policies with
respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate and choose to purchase products from a
competitor of us. We risk damage to our brands and our reputation in the event that our
corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various third
parties.

In addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding ESG
matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals,
or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. Any of these circumstances
could cause negative publicity and material and adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Moreover, not all of our competitors may seek to establish
climate or other ESG targets and goals, or at a comparable level to ours, which could result in
our competitors achieving competitive advantages through lower costs in supply chain or
operation, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition
and prospects.


-----

**Unfavorable results of legal and regulatory proceedings could materially adversely affect**
**our business and financial condition and performance.**

Although we are currently not subject to any litigation, we may in the future become
subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. Unfavorable outcomes regarding
these assessments could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any
particular reporting period. Results of legal and regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted
with certainty and for some matters, such as class actions, no insurance is cost-effectively
available. Regardless of merit, legal and regulatory proceedings may be both time-consuming
and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key
personnel from our business operations. Such proceedings could also generate significant
adverse publicity and have a negative impact on our reputation and brand image, regardless of
the existence or amount of liability. We estimate loss contingencies and establish accruals as
required by the applicable accounting standard, based on our assessment of contingencies
where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable, in light of the facts and
circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal
proceedings, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our
assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect
on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows
for the period in which amounts would be paid. Actual results may significantly vary from our
reserves.

**RISKS RELATING TO JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE**

**Uncertainties embedded in the legal systems of certain geographic markets where we**
**operate could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.**

The legal systems of the geographic markets where we operate vary significantly from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions have a civil law system based on written
statutes, while others are based on common law. Unlike the common law system, prior court
decisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential
value. The legal systems of some geographic markets where we operate are consistently
evolving. Laws and regulations that are recently enacted may not sufficiently cover all aspects
of economic activities in such markets. In particular, the interpretation and enforcement of
these laws and regulations are subject to future implementations, and the application of some
of these laws and regulations to our businesses is not settled. Since local administrative and
court authorities are authorized to interpret and implement statutory provisions and contractual
terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and
the level of legal protection we have in many of the geographic markets where we operate.

These uncertainties may affect our judgment on the relevance of legal requirements and
our ability to enforce our contractual rights or claims. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties
may be exploited through unmerited or frivolous legal actions, claims concerning the conduct
of third parties, or threats intended to extract payments or benefits from us.


-----

Furthermore, many of the legal systems in the geographic markets where we operate are
influenced by government policies and internal interpretations, some of which are not
published on a timely basis or at all and may have retroactive effects. There are other
circumstances where key regulatory definitions are unclear, imprecise or missing, or where
interpretations adopted by regulators are inconsistent with those applied by courts in analogous
cases. As a result, we may not become aware of our violation of certain policies or rules until
sometime after the violation has occurred. In addition, administrative and court proceedings in
certain of our geographic markets may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and
diversion of resources and management attention.

Operating across multiple jurisdictions also increases our compliance burden and cost
base. We must navigate different legal standards, licensing requirements, labor laws, tax
regimes, and reporting obligations, often requiring localized legal counsel and compliance
infrastructure. These complexities may slow down decision-making, increase operational
overhead, and heighten the risk of inadvertent noncompliance.

It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to be
applicable to us in our geographic markets and elsewhere that could affect our businesses and
operations. Scrutiny and regulation of the industries in which we operate may further increase,
and we may be required to devote additional legal and other resources to addressing these
regulations. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and
regulations in our geographic markets may slow the growth of our industries and affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**As a company listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market, we, our Directors,**
**senior management, employees and shareholders are subject to securities regulations and**
**exchange listing rules in the PRC. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory**
**requirements could result in sanctions, penalties, fines and regulatory measures, which**
**could have a material and adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition**
**and/or results of operations.**

As a company listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market, we, our Directors,
senior management, employees and shareholders are subject to securities regulations issued by
the CSRC and the listing rules of the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market. New regulations
and rules, and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations and rules,
may be adopted from time to time. We expect to fully comply with such regulations and rules
at all times and such compliance would require us to incur increased expenses and devote
considerable time and resources to such compliance. In addition, the CSRC and the Shanghai
Stock Exchange STAR Market may have periodic or ad hoc inspections, examinations and
inquiries with respect to our compliance with relevant regulatory requirements. Failure to
comply with the applicable regulatory requirements could also result in sanctions, penalties,
fines and/or regulatory measures. Accordingly, our reputation business, financial condition and
results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.


-----

**Changes in the political and economic policies, as well as the interpretation and**
**enforcement of law, rules and regulations in markets in which we operate may affect our**
**business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.**

Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected by the
economic, political, and legal developments in the jurisdictions where we operate. The overall
economic growth is influenced by the governmental regulations and policies in relation to
resource allocation, monetary policies, preferential treatment to particular industries or
companies and others. Any of the foregoing would affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects. Laws, rules and regulations in relation to economic matters
are promulgated from time to time, including those related to such as foreign investment,
corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation, finance, foreign exchange and
trade, so as to develop a comprehensive system of commercial law. In addition, the
interpretation and implementation of the laws and regulations may also evolve from time to
time, and we cannot assure you that our business operations will not be affected in the future.

**We are exposed to risks associated with our global presence and will continue to be**
**subject to such risks as we continue to expand our business overseas.**

We derive a significant portion of our revenue overseas. Accordingly, we have faced and
continue to face numerous risks, including legal, regulatory, political, economic, commercial
and other risks associated with conducting operations in various jurisdictions, any of which
could negatively affect our financial performance.

International expansion is a significant component of our growth which is primarily
driven by the expansion of our international customer base. While this strategy does not require
significant capital investment in overseas production facilities, it exposes us to risks associated
with our global presence. During the Track Record Period, revenue generated outside Chinese
Mainland accounted for 46.1%, 54.4% and 57.3% of our total revenue in 2023, 2024 and the
nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. We are subject to PRC law in addition
to the laws of the foreign countries and regions in which we or our customers operate. If any
of our operations, or our associates or agents, violate such laws, we could become subject to
sanctions or other penalties, which could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial
condition and results of operations.


-----

Our business operations are primarily located in the PRC. In addition, we may face
difficulties in managing our foundry partners, third-party providers of packaging and testing
services, distributors and other business partners on a global scale. Any negative changes in the
global geopolitical environment may materially and adversely affect our ability to secure stable
supplies from our foundry partners and, more generally, our ability to conduct our business.
These risks include the following:

-  legal, regulatory, political, economic and commercial instability and uncertainty;

-  changes in foreign tax rules, regulations and other requirements, such as changes in
tax rates and statutory and judicial interpretations of tax laws;

-  changes in international trade policies and regulations including those in relation to
economic sanctions, export controls and import restrictions, as well in trade barriers
such as imposition of tariffs;

-  difficulty in coping with possible conflict of laws resulting from import/export
controls measures of different jurisdictions where we operate;

-  changes in foreign country regulatory requirements, including data privacy laws;

-  complexities relating to compliance with foreign anti-bribery, anti-corruption and
anti-money laundering regulations and antitrust laws;

-  difficulty in obtaining or enforcing intellectual property rights;

-  difficulty in enforcing agreements and collecting overdue receivables through local
legal systems;

-  changes in geopolitical situations especially those in jurisdictions where we do
business;

-  strict foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions;

-  inflation and/or deflation, and changes in interest rates;

-  trade customer insolvency and the inability to collect accounts receivable;

-  challenges in communicating with clients and suppliers across different languages,
regions, and time zones;

-  challenges relating to foundries and third-party suppliers for packaging, testing, and
other services being unable to provide localized services to meet overseas client
demands, thereby reducing our product competitiveness;


-----

-  challenges associated with rising international shipping costs and extended transit
periods;

-  challenges in formulating effective local sales and marketing strategies targeting
customers from diverse jurisdictions and cultures;

-  geopolitical turmoil and instability in regions where our customers or suppliers
operate, and any resulting disruption, instability, or volatility in global markets and
industries; and

-  claims and lawsuits, including class actions, brought against us from courts or
regulators of other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our
reputation, business and results of operations.

Global trade disruption, significant introductions of trade barriers and bilateral trade
frictions as well as investment restrictions, together with any future downturns in the global
economy resulting therefrom, could adversely affect our financial performance and the
financial performance of our investments. If the aforementioned trade- and investment-related
issues continue, particularly due to geopolitical tensions, it could result in significant
additional impacts on the industries in which we operate, the jurisdictions of our investments,
and potentially lead to other adverse effects on our investments.

**We are subject to risks associated with sanctions and export control laws and regulations**
**and tariff risks.**

In recent years, the United States has increased export controls restrictions on China
through the Export Administration Regulations (the “EAR”) administered by the Bureau of
Industry and Security of the United States Department of Commerce (the “BIS”). While most
of the EAR’s restrictions are based on the country to which an item is exported, the BIS also
maintains lists of persons that are subject to enhanced export control restrictions. One such list
includes non-U.S. persons on which certain additional trade restrictions are imposed (the
“Entity List”). The EAR regulates U.S. export controls, and the BIS administers the EAR. The
U.S. export control regime regulates the export, re-export or in-country transfer or disclosure
of U.S. origin products, software, and technology to non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S.
persons based on the nature of the product or technology, as well as the destination, transferee,
or end-use of a specific export, re-export or in-country transfer. In addition to U.S. origin
products, a non-U.S.-produced item can be subject to the EAR if it incorporates or bundles
U.S.-origin controlled items valued at a certain ratio or utilizes certain U.S.-controlled
software or technologies during the production process. The BIS maintains lists of individuals
and entities subject to enhanced export control restrictions. One of these lists, the Entity List,
includes entities subject to specific licensing requirements for the export, re-export, or transfer
of certain products and technology subject to the EAR. In recent years, the BIS has added
hundreds of Chinese entities to the Entity List for a variety of reasons, including foreign policy,
defense policy, and national security. The export, re-export and in-country transfer of items
subject to the EAR to an entity on the Entity List is generally prohibited unless a license


-----

exception is available or specified license requirements are met. Our customers or suppliers
may be added to the Entity List and become subject to restrictions from sourcing or selling
technologies, software, or components from or to us. We may not be able to obtain, extend or
maintain the requisite licenses in relation to our transactions with these customers and
suppliers. The U.S. government also implements economic sanctions, primarily through the
U.S. Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and OFACadministered sanctions have increasingly targeted persons and entities in China. Because we
operate under a fabless model in China, it is not commercially feasible for us to avoid all
dealings with parties on the Entity List. As BIS export control rules continue to evolve, future
sanctions or export control measures may materially affect our business relationships with
certain key customers or suppliers. Engaging with Entity List customers or suppliers may
expose us to heightened regulatory and compliance risks under the EAR, particularly in light
of the U.S. government’s continued focus on enforcement actions involving China’s
semiconductor industry. These restrictions and regulations, and similar or more expansive
restrictions or regulations that may be imposed by the U.S. or other jurisdictions, may affect
our ability to acquire technologies, systems, devices or components that may be critical to our
technology infrastructure, product offerings and business operations. Any uncertainties and
changes in these current or future restrictions or regulations may have a negative impact on our
reputation and business.

We require our distributors and direct sales customers to comply with export regulations
promulgated by China, the U.S. and any other applicable governments, and the buyers shall not
sell our products to the countries or regions that are prohibited or sanctioned by relevant
regulations of any country or region. Based on our implementation of the compliance measures
to fulfill our export control obligations, our Directors are of the view that (i) our sales to our
customers do not violate the EAR; (ii) the EAR and the other related laws and regulations on
export controls had no material impact on the Group’s business operations and financial
performance during the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, and (iii) the
Group complied with the EAR in all material respects during the Track Record Period and up
to the Latest Practicable Date. However, U.S. export rules and sanctions are complex and
subject to significant changes; we cannot assure you that our compliance measures will always
be successful in avoiding violations. Also, as the EAR, U.S. sanctions laws and other
regulations and their implementation can change, future developments in sanctions and export
controls could significantly impact our business relationships with some of the key customers
or suppliers. If we fail to promptly secure alternative customers or sources of supply on
acceptable terms, our business may be materially and adversely affected. Any of these
developments could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business prospects, and
financial condition.

As a fabless IC design company, we rely on software and commodities subject to the
EAR, including certain electronic design automation (“EDA”) tools. In 2025, as the United
States continued to impose restrictions targeting China’s advanced semiconductor industry,
several major U.S. EDA suppliers disclosed that they had received notices from BIS in May
2025 requiring them to cease supplying EDA software to China. In July 2025, these suppliers
reported that BIS had rescinded those restrictions. However, there is no assurance that similar


-----

restrictions will not be reintroduced in the future. Such regulatory volatility may create
uncertainty in global supply chains, limit access to key design software, and increase
production and compliance costs for companies in affected industries. If these trade restrictions
or geopolitical tensions escalate, we may face additional risks, including reduced access to
essential EDA tools, which could adversely affect our design capabilities and product
development.

In addition, recent trade tensions, such as the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute, have led
to high tariffs, export controls and other restrictive measures targeting high-technology goods,
semiconductors and electronics. In April 2025, the United States imposed a 20% IEEPA
Fentanyl Tariff and a 125% IEEPA Reciprocal Tariff. In May 2025, IEEPA Reciprocal Tariff
was lowered to 10%. In November 2025, the United States government announced that IEEPA
Reciprocal Tariff would remain at 10% until November 10, 2026, while lowering the IEEPA
Fentanyl Tariff to 10%. Low value shipments into the United States through the international
postal network valued at US$800 or less are subject to 10% duty. Alternatively, for a period
of 6 months from August 29, 2025 (until February 2026), a specific duty rate of US$160 per
item is available.

Our products were not subject to the IEEPA Reciprocal Tariff, as it remained suspended,
but were subject to the reduced IEEPA Fentanyl Tariff of 10% as of the Latest Practicable Date.
On December 23, 2025, the U.S. government announced that it would increase tariffs on
Chinese semiconductor imports, with an initial tariff level of zero, increasing in 18 months on
June 23, 2027, to a rate to be announced not fewer than 30 days prior to that date. To our best
knowledge and based on the information provided by distributors about the intended locations
of their re-sales of our products, the estimated value of our products directly sold to, and resold
by distributors to, the United States accounted for less than 1% of the total revenue as well in
each year/period during the Track Record Period. Based on the above, our Directors believe
that the tariff measures imposed or potentially to be imposed in the future will have limited
impacts on our business. However, our products could be incorporated into various types of
end-products and be imported into the United States, with tariffs, if any, to be borne by the
importing party. Companies who import the products may wish to pass on the additional tariff
on our customers selling those end-products, which could ultimately be passed on to us. Even
if the tariff is not passed on to us, the reduced competitiveness of our customers’ end products
could lead to reduction or cancellation of their purchase orders from us.

**It may be difficult to effect service of process upon us or our management or to enforce**
**against them or us any judgments obtained from foreign courts.**

We are a company incorporated under the PRC laws and a majority of our assets are
located in Chinese Mainland. In addition, most of our Directors and senior management reside
in Chinese Mainland. As a result, it may be complex for [REDACTED] to effect service of
process outside of Chinese Mainland upon us, our Directors or senior management or to
enforce judgments obtained against us in courts outside Chinese Mainland. A judgment of a
court of another jurisdiction may be reciprocally recognized or enforced in Chinese Mainland
only if the jurisdiction has a treaty with Chinese Mainland or if the jurisdiction has been


-----

otherwise deemed by the courts of Chinese Mainland to satisfy the requirements for reciprocal
recognition, subject to the satisfaction of other requirements. However, Chinese Mainland is
not a party to treaties providing for the reciprocal enforcement of judgments of courts with
certain foreign countries such as the United States, and enforcement in Chinese Mainland of
judgments of a court in these jurisdictions may consequently be difficult or impossible. On
January 14, 2019, the Supreme People’s Court and the Department of Justice under the
Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region signed the Arrangement on
Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters by the
Courts of the Mainland and of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (關於內地與香
港特別行政區法院相互認可和執行民商事案件判決的安排) (the “2019 Arrangement”), which
became effective on January 29, 2024. The 2019 Arrangement regulates, among others, the
scope and particulars of judgments, the procedures and methods of the application for
recognition or enforcement, the review of the jurisdiction of the court that issued the original
judgment, the circumstances where the recognition and enforcement of a judgment shall be
refused, and the approaches towards remedies for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments in civil and commercial matters between the courts in Chinese Mainland and
those in Hong Kong. Therefore, judgments rendered by Hong Kong courts may be recognized
and enforced in the PRC if the requirements set forth by the 2019 Arrangement are met.
However, recognition and enforcement in the PRC of judgments of a court in any of these
jurisdictions other than Hong Kong in relation to any matter not subject to binding arbitration
provisions may be difficult or impossible.

**Fluctuations in exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our business, financial**
**condition and results of operations. Conversion between RMB and other currencies may**
**affect our business and operations, our ability to pay dividends and meet our financial**
**obligations, and the value of your investment.**

A substantial portion of the Group’s revenue and cost are not denominated in Renminbi.
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates against the Renminbi could result in changes in reported
revenue and results of operations due to the foreign exchange impact of translating these
transactions into Renminbi. Currency fluctuations could decrease revenue and increase our cost
of sales. During the Track Record Period, we recorded a net foreign exchange loss of RMB0.9
million in 2023, a net foreign exchange gain of RMB6.8 million in 2024 and a net foreign
exchange loss of RMB5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on
rates set by the PBOC. The Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times
significantly and unpredictably. The value of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other
currencies is affected by changes in the global political and economic conditions and by
China’s foreign exchange policies, among other things. We cannot assure you that Renminbi
will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar or other
currencies in the future. It is difficult to predict how market forces, international relationships
or policies may impact the exchange rate between Renminbi and the U.S. dollar or other
currencies in the future.


-----

Any significant appreciation or depreciation of Renminbi may materially and adversely
affect our revenue, earnings and financial position, and the value of any dividends we may pay.
For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive into Renminbi to
pay our operating expenses, appreciation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar could have an
adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we could receive from the conversion. Conversely, a
significant depreciation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar may significantly reduce the U.S.
dollar equivalent of our earnings.

There are limited hedging options available to reduce our exposure to exchange rate
fluctuations. We do not currently maintain any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our
exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging
transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and
we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure or at all. As a result, fluctuations in
exchange rates may have a material and adverse effect on your investment.

**Any decrease or discontinuation of tax rebate for our exported products may have a**
**negative effect on our profitability.**

According to the Notice of the Ministry of Finance and the SAT on the Value-Added Tax
and Consumption Tax Policy for Labor Services of Exported Goods (《財政部、國家稅務總局
關於出口貨物勞務增值稅和消費稅政策的通知》) issued by the MOF and the SAT on May 25,
2012, revised on December 9, 2014 and January 20, 2020, unless otherwise provided by law,
export goods and services are subject to the exemption and refund of VAT policies. In addition,
according to the PRC Value-Added Tax Law (中華人民共和國增值稅法) (the “VAT Law”),
which came into effect on January 1, 2026, unless otherwise provided, a taxpayer exporting
goods shall be subject to a zero VAT rate. Subject to the relevant PRC laws, we are entitled to
a rebate of VAT from the PRC tax authority in connection with our export sales for our
products. The tax rebate comprised a refund of VAT incurred on the raw materials we used for
production of our products in the PRC, which are subsequently exported to overseas countries.
We cannot assure you that the PRC governmental policies on tax rebate will not change or that
the current policies we enjoy will not be cancelled. If there is any reduction, suspension,
discontinuation or cancellation of tax rebate which may adversely affect the recoverability of
our VAT recoverable, our business, financial condition and profitability would be adversely
affected.

**Our Company is a PRC tax resident and is subject to PRC tax on its global income, and**
**the dividends payable to [REDACTED] and gains on [REDACTED] our H Shares by our**

[REDACTED] are subject to PRC tax.

As a PRC-incorporated company, under applicable PRC tax laws, we are required to pay
tax on our global income. Under applicable PRC tax laws, regulations and statutory documents,
non-PRC resident individuals and enterprises are subject to different tax obligations with
respect to dividends received from us or gains realized upon the sale or other disposition of our
H Shares.


-----

Non-PRC individuals are generally subject to PRC individual income tax under the
Individual Income Tax Law of the PRC (《中華人民共和國個人所得稅法》) with respect to
PRC source income or gains at a rate of 20%. For a Non-PRC individual who is not a resident
of the PRC, the receipt of dividends from an enterprise in the PRC is normally subject to
individual income tax of 20% unless a reduction is approved by the competent tax authority of
the State Council or exempted by an international convention or agreement to which the PRC
government is a party. We are required to withhold related tax from dividend payments paid to
non-PRC resident individuals, unless specifically exempted by the tax authority of the State
Council or reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty. Non-resident individual H Share
holders should be aware that they may be obligated to pay PRC income tax on the dividends
and bonus realized from the H Shares.

Non-PRC resident enterprises that do not have establishments or premises in China, or
that have establishments or premises in China but their income is not related to such
establishments or premises are subject to the EIT at the rate of 10% on dividends received from
Chinese companies and gains realized upon disposition of equity interests in Chinese
companies pursuant to the EIT Law and other applicable PRC tax regulations and statutory
documents, which may be reduced or eliminated under special arrangements or applicable
treaties between China and the jurisdiction where the non-resident enterprise resides. Non-PRC
resident enterprises that are entitled to be taxed at a reduced rate under an applicable income
tax treaty will be required to apply to the PRC tax authorities for a refund of any amount
withheld in excess of the applicable treaty rate, payment of any such refund will be subject to
the PRC tax authorities’ verification. As of the date of this document, there were no specific
rules on how to levy tax on gains realized by non-resident enterprise H Share holders through
the sale or transfer by other means of the H Shares. If any such tax were to be levied, the

[REDACTED] of our H Shares may be materially and adversely affected.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE [REDACTED]**

**We will be concurrently subject to [REDACTED] and regulatory requirements of Chinese**
**Mainland and Hong Kong.**

As we are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market and will be

[REDACTED] on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange, we will be required to comply with
the listing rules (where applicable) and other applicable regulatory regimes of all two
jurisdictions, unless an exemption is available or a waiver has been obtained. Accordingly, we
may incur additional costs and resources in continuously complying with all sets of listing
rules in the two jurisdictions.


-----

**Our A Shares are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market, and the**
**characteristics of the A share and H share markets may differ.**

Our A Shares are listed and traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market.
Following the [REDACTED], our A Shares will continue to be traded on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange STAR Market and our H Shares will be [REDACTED] on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange. Under current laws and regulations of Chinese Mainland, without the approval from
the relevant regulatory authorities, our H Shares and A Shares are neither interchangeable nor
fungible, and there is no [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] between the H Share and A Share
markets. With different [REDACTED] characteristics, the H Share and A Share markets have
divergent [REDACTED] volumes, liquidity and [REDACTED] bases, as well as different
levels of retail and institutional [REDACTED] participation. As a result, the [REDACTED]
of our H Shares and A Shares may not be comparable. Nonetheless, fluctuations in the price
of our A Shares may adversely affect the [REDACTED] of our H Shares, and vice versa. Due
to the different characteristics of the H Share and A Share markets, the historical prices of our
A Shares may not be indicative of the [REDACTED] of our H Shares. You should therefore
not place undue reliance on the [REDACTED] of our A Shares when evaluating the

[REDACTED] decision in our H Shares.

**There has been no prior public market for our H Shares, and an active [REDACTED]**
**market for our H Shares may not develop or be sustained.**

Prior to the [REDACTED], there was no public market for our H Shares. We cannot
assure you that a public market for our H Shares with adequate liquidity and [REDACTED]
volume will develop and be sustained following the completion of the [REDACTED]. In
addition, the [REDACTED] of our H Shares is expected to be fixed by agreement between the

[REDACTED] (for themselves and on behalf of the [REDACTED]) and us, and may not be
an indication of the [REDACTED] of our H Shares following the completion of the

[REDACTED]. If an active public market for our H Shares does not develop following the
completion of the [REDACTED], the liquidity and [REDACTED] of our H Shares may be
materially and adversely affected.

**The price and [REDACTED] of our H Shares may be volatile, which could lead to**
**substantial losses to [REDACTED].**

The [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] volume of our H Shares may be subject to
significant volatility in response to various factors beyond our control, including the general
market conditions of the securities in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the world. The Hong Kong
Stock Exchange and other securities markets have, from time to time, experienced significant
price and [REDACTED] volume volatility that are not related to the operating [REDACTED]
of any particular company. The business and performance and the [REDACTED] of the shares
of other companies engaging in similar business may also affect the price and [REDACTED]
of our H Shares. In addition to market and industry factors, the [REDACTED] and

[REDACTED] of our H Shares may be highly volatile for specific business reasons, such as
fluctuations in our revenue, earnings, cash flows, investments, expenditures, regulatory


-----

developments, relationships with our suppliers, movements or activities of key personnel, or
actions taken by competitors. Moreover, shares of other companies listed on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange have experienced price volatility in the past, and it is possible that our H
Shares may be subject to changes in price not directly related to our performance.

**Future sales or perceived sales of substantial amounts of our H Shares in the**

[REDACTED] could have a material adverse effect on the prevailing [REDACTED] of
**our H Shares and our ability to raise additional capital in the future, or may result in**
**dilution of your shareholding.**

The [REDACTED] of our H Shares and our ability to raise equity capital in the future
at a time and price that we deem appropriate could be negatively impacted as a result of future
sales of a substantial number of our H Shares or other securities relating to our H Shares in the
public market, especially by our Directors, executive officers and our Single Largest Group of
Shareholders, or the issuance of new shares or other securities, or the perception that such sales
or issuances may occur. In addition, our Shareholders may experience dilution in their holdings
if we issue more securities in the future. Furthermore, we may issue shares pursuant to any
existing or future share option incentive schemes, which would further dilute our Shareholders’
interests in our Company. New shares or shares-linked securities issued by us may also confer
rights and privileges that take priority over those conferred by the H Shares. Certain amount
of the shares of our Company controlled by our Single Largest Group of Shareholders are
subject to certain [REDACTED] beginning on the date on which [REDACTED] in our H
Shares commences on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. While we currently are not aware of
any intention of such persons to dispose of significant amounts of their shares after the expiry
of the [REDACTED], we cannot assure you that they will not dispose of any shares of our
Company they may own now or in the future. [REDACTED] of shares of our Company by
such Shareholders and the availability of these Shares for future [REDACTED] may have a
negative impact on the [REDACTED] of our shares.

In addition, while [REDACTED] shares in the [REDACTED] are not subject to any
restrictions on the disposal of the H Shares they [REDACTED] (except as disclosed in the
section headed “[REDACTED]”), they may have existing arrangements or agreement to
dispose part or all of the H Shares they hold immediately or within a certain period upon
completion of the [REDACTED] for legal and regulatory, business and market, or other
reasons. Such disposal may occur within a short period or any time or period after the

[REDACTED]. Any [REDACTED] of the H Shares [REDACTED] by such [REDACTED]
pursuant to such arrangement or agreement could adversely affect the [REDACTED] of our H
Shares and any sizeable sale could have a material and adverse effect on the [REDACTED]
of our H Shares and could cause substantial volatility in the [REDACTED] volume of our H
Shares.

**The interests of our Single Largest Group of Shareholders may not be aligned with the**
**interests of other Shareholders.**

Immediately following the completion of the [REDACTED] and assuming the

[REDACTED] is not exercised, no further Shares are issued under the Restricted Share
Incentive Plans and no other changes are made to the issued share capital of our Company
between the Latest Practicable Date and the [REDACTED], our Single Largest Group of
Shareholders will hold approximately [REDACTED] of the issued share capital of our
Company (taking into account the shares held by persons acting in concert with him). This
concentration of ownership may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our
Company, which could deprive other Shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for
their shares of our Company as part of a sale of our Company and might reduce the

[REDACTED] of our H Shares. These events may occur even if they are opposed by our other
Shareholders. In addition, the interests of our Single Largest Group of Shareholders may differ
from the interests of our other Shareholders. It is possible that our Single Largest Group of
Shareholders may exercise their substantial influence over us and cause us to enter into
transactions or take, or fail to take, actions or make decisions that conflict with the best
interests of our other Shareholders.

**Our historical dividends may not be indicative of our future dividend policy, and there**
**can be no assurance whether and when we will pay dividends in the future.**

We have declared dividends in the past. We protect our Shareholders’ interest by ensuring
a consistent dividend policy. However, there is no assurance that dividends of any amount will
be declared or distributed by us in any year in the future. Under the applicable laws and
regulations of Chinese Mainland, the payment of dividends may be subject to certain
limitations, and the calculation of our profit under the Accounting Standards for Business
Enterprises may differ in certain respects from the calculation under IFRS Accounting
Standards. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends are subject to the
discretion of our Directors, after taking into account various factors, including but not limited
to our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, capital expenditure requirements,
market conditions, our strategic plans and prospects for business development, regulatory
restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors as our Directors may deem relevant,
and subject to the approval at Shareholders’ meeting. Any declaration and payment as well as
the amount of dividends will be subject to our constitutional documents and the applicable laws
and regulations of Chinese Mainland. See “Financial Information — Dividend Policy” for
further details of our dividend policy. No dividend shall be declared or payable except out of
our profits and reserves lawfully available for distribution. Our historical dividends should not
be taken as indicative of our dividend policy in the future.

Under the existing foreign exchange regulations of Chinese Mainland, payments of
current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and
service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior
SAFE approval by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from
or registration with competent government authorities is required where RMB is to be


-----

converted into foreign currency and remitted out of Chinese Mainland to pay capital expenses
such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. If the foreign exchange
control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign
currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our
Shareholders. Further, we cannot assure you that new regulations will not be promulgated in
the future that would have the effect of further restricting the remittance of RMB into or out
of Chinese Mainland.

**You should not place any reliance on any information released by us in connection with**
**the listing of our A Shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market when**

[REDACTED] in our H Shares.

As our A Shares are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market, we have been
subject to periodic reporting and other information disclosure requirements in Chinese
Mainland. As a result, from time to time, we publicly release information relating to us on the
Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market or other media outlets designated by the CSRC.
However, the information announced by us in connection with our A Shares listing is based on
regulatory requirements of the securities authorities, industry standards and market practices in
Chinese Mainland, which are different from those applicable to the [REDACTED]. The
presentation of financial and operational information for the Track Record Period disclosed on
the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market or other media outlets may not be directly
comparable to the financial and operational information contained in this document. As a
result, prospective [REDACTED] in our H Shares should be reminded that, in making their

[REDACTED] decisions as to whether to [REDACTED] our H Shares, they should rely only
on the financial, operating and other information included in this document. By applying to

[REDACTED] our H Shares in the [REDACTED], you will be deemed to have agreed that
you will not rely on any information other than that contained in this document and any formal
announcements made by us in Hong Kong with respect to the [REDACTED].

**You should read the entire document carefully and only rely on the information included**
**in this document to make your [REDACTED] decision, and we strongly caution you not**
**to rely on any information contained in press articles or other media coverage relating to**
**us, our Shares or the [REDACTED].**

We strongly caution our [REDACTED] not to rely on any information contained in press
articles or other media regarding us, our Shares and the [REDACTED]. Prior to the publication
of this document, there may be press and media coverage regarding the [REDACTED] and us.
Such press and media coverage may include references to certain information that does not
appear in this document, including certain operating and financial information and projections,
valuations and other information. We have not authorized the disclosure of any such
information in the press or media and do not accept any responsibility for any such press or
media coverage or the accuracy or completeness of any such information or publication. We
make no representation as to the appropriateness, accuracy, completeness or reliability of any
such information or publication. To the extent that any such information is inconsistent or
conflicts with the information contained in this document, we disclaim responsibility for it and
our [REDACTED] should not rely on such information.

**Certain facts, forecasts and other statistics in this document obtained from official**
**government sources have not been independently verified and may not be reliable.**

Certain facts, forecast and other statistics in this document are derived from various
official government sources. However, our Directors cannot guarantee the quality or reliability
of such source materials. We believe that the sources of the said information are appropriate
sources for such information and have taken reasonable care in extracting and reproducing such
information. We have no reason to believe that such information is false or misleading or that
any fact has been omitted that would render such information false or misleading.
Nevertheless, information from official government sources has not been independently
verified by us, the Sole Sponsor, the [REDACTED], the [REDACTED], the [REDACTED],
the [REDACTED], the [REDACTED] or any of their respective affiliates or advisers and,
therefore, we make no representation as to the accuracy of such facts and statistics. Further, we
cannot assure our [REDACTED] that they are stated or compiled on the same basis or with the
same degree of accuracy as similar statistics presented elsewhere. In all cases, our

[REDACTED] should consider carefully how much weight or importance should be attached
to or placed on such facts or statistics.

**Forward-looking statements contained in this document are subject to risks and**
**uncertainties.**

This document contains forward-looking statements with respect to our business
strategies, operating efficiencies, competitive positions, growth opportunities for existing
operations, plans and objectives of management, certain [REDACTED] information and other
matters. The words “aim”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “predict”, “potential”, “continue”,
“expect”, “intend”, “may”, “might”, “plan”, “seek”, “will”, “would”, “should” and the negative
of these terms and other similar expressions identify a number of these forward-looking
statements. These forward looking statements, including, amongst others, those relating to our
future business prospects, capital expenditure, cash flows, working capital, liquidity and
capital resources are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of our Directors and
management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. As a consequence,
these forward-looking statements should be considered in light of various important factors,
including those set out in this section. Accordingly, such statements are not a guarantee of
future performance and [REDACTED] should not place undue reliance.

**U.S. persons [REDACTED] our H Shares in the [REDACTED] may be required to file**
**notifications with the U.S. Treasury under the U.S. government’s new China-focused**
**Outbound Investment Security Program, and we could be negatively impacted by possible**
**changes to this program. These requirements and possible changes to the program may**
**adversely affect the value of our [REDACTED] securities.**

On August 9, 2023, the U.S. government issued an executive order and the U.S.
Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) published an advanced notice of proposed
rulemaking providing a conceptual framework for outbound investment controls focused on
China, including Hong Kong and Macau (the “Outbound Investment Security Program” or
the “OISP”). On June 21, 2024, Treasury issued a proposed rule for the OISP. On October 28,
2024, Treasury issued a final rule (the “Final Rule”) setting forth the OISP regulations that
implement the executive order of August 9, 2023, which targets transactions by U.S. persons
that involve persons and entities associated with “countries of concern,” currently China,
including Hong Kong and Macau, with business in certain technology sectors. The Final Rule
took effect on January 2, 2025. The OISP could apply to certain U.S. persons (including their
controlled foreign entities, if applicable) outside the United States who may participate in the

[REDACTED] through offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S.

The OISP could potentially limit our ability to raise additional capital from U.S.

[REDACTED] or prevent us from securing sufficient capital when needed and at reasonable
cost, negatively affecting our business, financial condition and prospects. As advised by the

[REDACTED] legal advisor as to the U.S. outbound investment rules, we are likely to be
deemed a “Covered Foreign Person” engaged in the design and packaging of semiconductors
specified in the OISP. Specifically, we are engaged in the design and packaging of integrated
circuits that are covered by the definition of “notifiable transaction” but not covered by the
definition of “prohibited transaction” (as defined in the OISP). Certain U.S. person transactions
with Covered Foreign Persons that meet the criteria described above are covered by the OISP’s
U.S. person notification requirements. Even though U.S. persons’ purchase of certain publicly
traded securities, such as our currently outstanding A Shares that already are traded on the
Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market and the H Shares to be [REDACTED] on the Stock
Exchange after the [REDACTED] pursuant to the [REDACTED], may be neither prohibited
transactions nor notifiable transactions under an exception in the Final Rule (the “Publicly
**Traded Securities Exception”) so long as the investment does not afford the U.S. person**
rights beyond standard minority shareholder protections with respect to the covered foreign
person, it appears unlikely that U.S. persons’ [REDACTED] of our H Shares to be

[REDACTED] in the [REDACTED] would be eligible for the Publicly Traded Securities
Exception. If the Publicly Traded Securities Exception is unavailable, U.S. persons (as defined
under the Final Rule) that either [REDACTED] our H Shares in the [REDACTED] or are the
parent of a non-U.S. person that [REDACTED] our H Shares in the [REDACTED] would be
required to file a notification regarding such [REDACTED] with Treasury no later than 30
days after the relevant [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] should consult their legal counsel
regarding the applicability of the Publicly Traded Securities Exception to the [REDACTED],
notification obligations, if any, applicable to them under the OISP, and the procedures for filing
such notifications. Failing to comply with the OISP notification requirements or failing to


-----

provide accurate and complete information in the filing under the OISP may subject the
relevant U.S. persons to civil penalties including fines of up to the greater of two times the
transaction value or US$377,700 (as such amount may be adjusted for inflation), and — for
willful violations — criminal penalties of fines of up to US$1 million and imprisonment of up
to 20 years. Because the OISP regulates U.S. persons and, in some cases, U.S. persons
controlling or directing non-U.S. person-investors, and not the entities they are investing in,
none of our Company, the Single Largest Group of Shareholders, the Directors and senior
management of our Company will be required to file notifications pursuant to the Final Rule.

The OISP may be changed by executive actions of the U.S. government, including
changes to the scope of activities and technologies applicable to notifiable or prohibited
transactions or the scope and the availability of exceptions to the OISP’s prohibitions or
notification requirements. Specifically, on January 20, 2025, the U.S. government issued a
national security presidential memorandum, entitled “America First Trade Policy,” which,
among other things, directs the Secretary of the Treasury and several other executive
departments and offices of the U.S. government to review the OISP to determine if it includes
“sufficient controls to address national security threats” and to determine whether the
executive order implementing the OISP “should be modified or rescinded and replaced.” In
addition, on February 21, 2025, the U.S. government issued a national security presidential
memorandum entitled “America First Investment Policy” which, among other things, states
that the U.S. government will consider possible application of the OISP to a wider range of
technology sectors and application of restrictions to a wider range of investments, including
publicly traded securities. On April 3, 2025, the White House reported that Treasury and the
National Security Council were evaluating options relating to the OISP and that the Trump
Administration plans to evaluate whether the scope of outbound investment restrictions should
be expanded. Possible changes to the OISP could limit or, in the worst-case scenario, eliminate
our ability to raise capital or contingent equity capital (such as convertible bonds) from U.S.
investors in the future, or our ability to raise such capital may be significantly and negatively
affected, which could be detrimental to our capital-raising capacity and our business, financial
condition and prospects. In addition, changes to the Publicly Traded Securities Exception or
other aspects of the OISP could prohibit the purchase or trading of our [REDACTED]
securities by U.S. persons, impose new notification or other regulatory requirements, or make
our [REDACTED] securities less attractive to such investors. In such cases, the value of our

[REDACTED] securities could significantly decline, and our liquidity may be materially and
adversely affected.
