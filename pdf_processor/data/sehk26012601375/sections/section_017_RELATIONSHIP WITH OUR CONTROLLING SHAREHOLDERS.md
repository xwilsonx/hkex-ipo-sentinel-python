**INDEPENDENCE FROM OUR CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS**

Our Directors consider that we are capable of carrying on our business
independently from our Controlling Shareholders and/or their respective close associates
upon [REDACTED], taking into consideration the factors below:

**Management Independence**

Our Company is managed by our Board and senior management. Upon

[REDACTED], our Board will consist of nine Directors comprising four Executive
Directors, one Non-Executive Director and four Independent Non-Executive Directors.
For more information, see “Directors and Senior Management.” in this document.


-----

We believe that our Directors and senior management are able to perform their roles
in our Company independently and our Company is capable of managing its business
independently from our Controlling Shareholders and their respective close associates for
the following reasons:

(i) Ms. Zhou as the Chairperson of our Board, an Executive Director and our
General Manager, devotes substantially all her time to discharge her duties of
her positions at our Group;

(ii) each of our Directors is aware of the fiduciary duties as a Director which
require, among other things, that they act for the benefit and in the best
interests of our Company and does not allow their personal interests to
interfere with our Company’s best interest;

(iii) our daily management and operation are carried out by our Executive
Directors and senior management, all of whom have substantial experience in
the industry in which our Company is engaged, and will therefore be able to
make business decisions that are in the best interest of our Group;

(iv) in the event that there is a potential conflict of interest arising out of any
transaction to be entered into between our Group and our Directors or their
respective close associates, the interested Directors shall abstain from voting
on any resolutions of our Board of Directors approving any contract,
arrangement or any other proposal in which they or any of their close
associates has a material interest and shall not be counted in the quorum
present at the relevant meetings of the Board of Directors;

(v) we will have four Independent Non-Executive Directors upon [REDACTED],
comprising more than one-third of our Board of Directors, to provide a
balance of the number of our Board of Directors and with a view to ensure that
the decisions of our Board of Directors are made only after due consideration
of independent and impartial opinions. We believe our Independent
Non-Executive Directors individually and collectively possess the requisite
knowledge and experience to provide professional and experienced advice to
our Company. Our Directors are of the view that our Independent
Non-Executive Directors are able to protect the interests of our Company and
our Shareholders as a whole;

(vi) as an A-share listed company, we have formulated and adopted a
comprehensive internal control and management system in compliance with
the relevant requirements of the rules of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. We
have established clear reporting lines among the management team of our
Company and between our management team and the Board; and


-----

(vii) we have adopted corporate governance measures and sufficient and effective
control mechanisms to manage conflicts of interest, if any, between our Group
and our Controlling Shareholders, which would support our independent
management. See “— Corporate Governance” for further details.

Based on the above, our Directors are of the view that our Board of Directors,
together with our senior management, are able to perform their managerial roles in our
Group independently from our Controlling Shareholders and/or their respective close
associates.

**Operational Independence**

We do not rely on our Controlling Shareholders and their respective close associates
for our business development, staffing, logistics, administration, finance, internal audit,
IT, sales and marketing, or company secretarial functions. We have our own departments
specializing in the respective areas which have been in operation and are expected to
continue to operate independently from our Controlling Shareholders and/or their
respective close associates. In addition, we have our own headcount of employees for our
operation and management for human resources.

We have independent access to our suppliers and customers. We are in possession of
all relevant licenses, certificates, facilities and intellectual property rights necessary to
carry on and operate our principal business and we have sufficient operational capacity in
terms of capital and employees to operate independently.

We have very minimum number of transactions with our Controlling Shareholders
and/or their respective close associates, which will continue upon [REDACTED]. See
“Connected Transactions” in this Document for further details of these transactions. All
such transactions will be conducted on arm’s length and on normal commercial terms in
the ordinary and usual course of business of our Group in accordance with the
requirements under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules, and the pricing policy of our Group
and our connected persons and not be prejudicial to the interest of any of the parties.
Considering that the amounts of the relevant transactions are not significant to our Group,
our Directors believe that such transactions will not have any impact on the operational
independence of our Group.

Based on the above, our Directors believe that we are able to operate independently
of our Controlling Shareholders and/or their respective close associates.


-----

**Financial Independence**

Our Group has an independent financial system and makes financial decisions
according to our own business needs. We have our own internal control and accounting
system and finance department to perform independent treasury function on cash receipts
and payments, independent accounting and reporting functions and independent internal
control function. Neither our Controlling Shareholders nor their respective close
associates intervene with our use of funds. We have adequate internal resources and credit
profile to support our daily operation, and we are capable of obtaining financing from
independent third parties without relying on any guarantee or security provided by our
Controlling Shareholders or their respective close associates. As of the Latest Practicable
Date, we did not have any outstanding borrowing or guarantee from our Controlling
Shareholders or any of their respective close associates.

Based on the above, our Directors are of the view that we are able to maintain
financial independence from our Controlling Shareholders and/or their respective close
associates.

**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE**

Our Company will comply with the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code
in Appendix C1 to the Listing Rules (the “Corporate Governance Code”), which set out
principles of good corporate governance.

Our Directors recognize the importance of good corporate governance in protection
of our Shareholders’ interests. We would adopt the following measures to safeguard good
corporate governance standards and to avoid potential conflicts of interest between our
Company and our Controlling Shareholders.

respective close associates has a material interest, such Director(s) shall

any of his/her respective close associates has a material interest nor shall such
Director be counted in the quorum present at the Board meeting;


-----

connected transactions. Upon [REDACTED], if our Company enters into
connected transactions with our Controlling Shareholders and/or any of their
respective close associates, our Company will comply with the applicable
Listing Rules;

(e) we commit that our Board shall include a balanced composition of Executive
Director and Non-Executive Directors (including Independent Non-Executive
Directors). We will have four Independent Non-Executive Directors upon

possess sufficient experiences, (ii) are free of any business or other
relationship which could interfere in any material manner with the exercise of
their independent judgment, and (iii) will be able to provide an impartial and
external opinion to protect the interests of our Shareholders as a whole. For

various requirements relating to corporate governance.

Based on the above, our Directors are satisfied that sufficient corporate governance
measures have been put in place to manage conflicts of interest between our Company and
our Controlling Shareholders, and to protect minority Shareholders’ interests upon
