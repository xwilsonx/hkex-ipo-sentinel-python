In addition, the automotive industry is sensitive to general economic conditions,
including interest rates, inflation, consumer demand and spending levels, and
geopolitical issues. Automotive sales and production can also be affected by the age of the
vehicles and related scrappage rates, labor relations issues, labor shortages, energy prices,
regulatory requirements, government initiatives and incentives, trade agreements,
sanctions, tariffs and other non-tariff trade barriers, more stringent environment
protection laws, the availability and cost of credit, the availability and cost of raw
materials and critical components and logistics issues, as well as vehicle affordability and
consumer preferences regarding vehicle powertrains, size, configuration and features,
among other factors. In case the automotive industry, globally or in any particular region
to which our products are related to, is affected negatively, it may also cause adverse effect
to our performance. Our sales and production may be further affected by new entrants to
the industry, including domestic automotive manufacturers in certain regions and NEV
automotive manufacturers.

Meanwhile, adverse changes in economic conditions of the countries and regions
where we sell our products to, significant downturns in our industry, regulatory changes
impacting our supply chain and the purchasing patterns of vehicles, including the ability
to trade across borders and import and export our products, and changes in the local
economies of the countries or regions in which we sell our products, such as changes in
consumer confidence, increases in interest rates, inflation and increases in unemployment
or the financial distress of one or more of our major customers could result in a decline in
the production levels of our major customers, particularly with respect to models for
which we are a significant supplier, which could negatively affect demand for our
products, reduce our sales or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, operating
results and cash flows.

**We operate in a relatively competitive industry, and we may be unable to continually**
**maintain our market position.**

We primarily operate in the automotive lighting market, which are relatively
competitive. We compete with a number of other PRC or international companies that
produce and sell similar products. Among other factors, our products compete on the
basis of price, quality, technological innovation, design and performance, manufacturing
and sales capability, delivery and customer services. Some of our competitors are larger
and have greater financial and other resources than us. Some of our competitors may also
have a competitive advantage in particular products or as a result of long-term
relationships or ownership interests with certain customers. Our ability to compete
successfully depends largely on our ability to maintain our advantages in areas such as
technological advancement, quality and services, and to differentiate and stay ahead of
our competitors with respect to our products. We continue to invest in technology and
innovation which are critical to our long-term growth. Our ability to maintain advanced
R&D ability and improve existing products, while successfully developing and
introducing distinctive new and enhanced products that anticipate changing customer
and consumer preferences and capitalize upon emerging technologies, is also important
for us to remain competitive. If we are unsuccessful or are less successful than our
competitors in predicting the course of market development, developing innovative
products, processes or use of materials or adapting to new technologies or evolving
regulatory, industry or customer requirements, we may be placed at a competitive
disadvantage.


-----

In addition, competition may make it more difficult for us to secure new projects,
which may in turn put pressure on our revenue and profits and adversely affect our profit
margins. Therefore, the ability to stay ahead of our competitors will be fundamental to our
future success. If we do not continue to keep our existing production and quality leverage,
continuously innovate to develop new and compelling products that effectively compete
with our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be
materially and adversely affected.

**If we fail to keep up with the evolution of technologies or adapt our products and**
**technology to emerging industry standards, or if our investments in new technologies**
**prove unsuccessful or ineffective, our business may be materially and adversely**
**affected.**

The automotive industry and automotive intelligence technologies are rapidly
evolving. Our business and prospects will depend on our ability to effectively identify
consumer needs, develop and introduce new products, cost-effectively enhance current
products and the adoption of automotive intelligence products in the market by factors
such as comprehensiveness of functionalities, cost considerations, driver and passenger
preferences, and consumers’ awareness of automotive intelligence products.

The revolution of technologies and the emergence of new industry standards also
pose significant challenges. If we fail to keep up with these changes or adapt our
technology accordingly, our competitive position could be compromised. This may
necessitate additional investments in technology upgrades and process improvements to
align with industry standards. Failure to do so could result in our products becoming
obsolete, leading to a potential loss of market share and adversely affecting our business
operations.

Our R&D efforts cover the intelligent upgrade of our core automotive lighting
products and have also been expanded into our strategic emerging businesses. In respect
of intelligent automotive lighting products, based on our existing technologies, we intend
to focus our expansion on intelligent lighting products, including intelligent projection
headlamps, display and interactive lamps, intelligent projection small lamps, intelligent
cockpit lighting products and automotive lighting controllers. In respect of new products
and business expansion, the new products we are actively developing include domain
controllers, CMS (camera monitoring system) and components of embodied intelligent
robots. Although we believe that the intelligent upgrade of our products and the
development of new technologies and new products will enable us to remain at the
forefront of industry technology and meet the evolving needs of our customers, the
development of such new products and new technologies involves technological
challenges and risks and requires substantial capital investment and expertise. We cannot
assure that our R&D approach will always align with market and customer demand, nor
can we assure that such efforts will ultimately result in commercially viable products. In
addition, with the rapid upgrading and innovation of the automotive industry, the
automotive lighting sector is also facing rapid technological advancements and evolving
industry standards, which may render our current development obsolete, require us to
continuously adjust and modify our technologies and R&D direction or even abandon
certain projects in progress, and may require significant additional investment for us to
remain competitive.


-----

**If our investments in new products and technologies prove unsuccessful or ineffective,**
**our business may be materially and adversely affected.**

Technology innovation is key to our success. During the Track Record Period, we
made substantial R&D investments, which we believe are crucial factors for our future
growth and prospects. For 2023 and 2024 and the nine-month period ended September 30,
2024 and September 30, 2025, our research and development expenses amounted to
RMB610.2 million, RMB655.5 million, RMB463.1 million and RMB640.6 million,
respectively, accounting for 6.0%, 4.9%, 5.0% and 6.0% of our total revenue in the
respective years/periods.

However, there can be no assurance that our R&D projects will yield the expected
outcome or be completed within the anticipated time frame and budget. If we fail to
commercialize our R&D efforts, we may incur significant sunk costs. Even if the newly
developed products can be launched as we expected, there can be no assurance that they
will be accepted by our customers and achieve the anticipated sales target or profit. In
addition, a portion of our research and development expenses are allocated to developing
general technologies rather than specific products. While this investment is important for
long-term innovation and capability building, it may not immediately enhance the
competitiveness of our products in the market or produce the expected benefits or returns.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our existing or potential competitors will not
develop products which are similar or superior to our products or are more competitively
priced. In such cases, we may lose market share. Due to uncertainties in the time frame for
developing new products and the duration of market windows for these products, there is
a risk that we may have to abandon a product that is no longer commercially viable, even
after we have invested significant resources in the development of such product.

During any operating period, if our R&D and technology investments lead to
increased costs due to market conditions or competitive pressure, or if our R&D fails to
achieve the expected results, our financial performance may be adversely affected.


-----

**We currently may be exposed to customer concentration risk. Failure to retain our**
**existing customers or attract new ones could materially and adversely impact our**
**business, financial condition and results of operations.**

In order to increase our revenue and maintain our growth, we are committed to
retaining existing customers, especially key customers, and attracting new customers.
Automotive lights are products specifically designed for different vehicle models, and our
customers primarily consist of automotive manufacturers that purchase our products for
their vehicle models. Since the automotive manufacturing industry (particularly
passenger vehicles) is relatively concentrated with a relatively limited number of
large-scale enterprises, a high level of customer concentration is also the characteristic of
the automotive lighting industry, which is the major production area engaged by us. In
2023, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2025, revenue generated from our
five largest customers in aggregate for each year/period respectively was RMB6,989.0
million, RMB9,199.1 million and RMB7,144.7 million, representing 68.2%, 69.5% and
66.7% of our total revenue, respectively. See “Business — Sales and Marketing — Our
Customers” for details.

Enlargement of our PRC and international customer group and expanding our
customer categories are the continuous efforts we have persisted since our establishment.
The stable relationship with our key existing customers and consistent demands are
crucial to our business. Their business conditions, liquidity and solvency may have a
significant impact on our business dealings. Any disruption in our business relationship
with our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

However, we cannot guarantee that our existing key customers will continue to
procure our products for their new vehicle models at a consistent or even increasing level
or will maintain their partnerships with us for our ongoing projects or future projects. Our
ability to retain key existing customers or attract new customers depends on the following
factors, some of which are out of our control:

-  the competitiveness of our pricing and payment terms for our customers,
which may, in turn, be constrained by our capital and financial resources;

-  the market acceptance of our new products, services and functionalities;

-  our ability to continue investing in R&D to accommodate our customers’
need;

-  mergers and acquisitions among market players; and

-  the effects of domestic and global economic conditions on the development of
the automotive industry generally.


-----

Accordingly, the demand for our products may be affected by our ability to maintain
our relationships with our key existing customers and attract new customers. Although,
after years of development, we have broaden our customer base to both major Chinese
passenger vehicle manufacturers and international ones, with well built-up long-term
strategic alliances, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our
relationships with them in the future. Demand from our key existing customers may fall
short of our estimates due to changes in our major customers’ business models, strategies
or financial condition, preferences or policies incentivizing the purchase of alternative
products, or changes in the automotive lighting market environment and macroeconomic
conditions, among other things. If we experience a significant decline in sales order and
demand from our existing customers and unable to acquire new customers that may
procure similarly or even more for our products, our business, financial condition and
results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

**Our business depends substantially on the expertise and dedication of our management**
**team and highly skilled personnel on a global scale. We may face challenges in**
**recruiting and retaining such individuals, which could impede our technological**
**advancement and business growth.**

We have been, and will continue to be, substantially dependent on the continued
services of our management team and skilled personnel. Retaining talent in a global
business operation involves navigating challenges, including cultural differences that
affect employee engagement and satisfaction and intense competition for skilled
professionals. Additionally, legal and regulatory compliance varies by country,
complicating employment contracts and benefits. We also endeavor to keep
communication and integration within our global teams with the implementation of
nuanced retention strategies that balance global consistency with local adaptation.

However, we cannot assure you that we will continue to successfully retain our
management team and skilled personnel. If we lose the services of any key member of
them, we may not be able to find suitable replacements in a timely manner, at acceptable
cost or at all, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects
could be materially and adversely affected. The shortage of skilled professionals could
lead to delays in product development, hinder our ability to respond to market demands,
and affect our capacity to manage and integrate our international operations effectively.

As our business continues to grow globally, the demand for skilled R&D and
international management personnel has significantly increased. Our ability to innovate
and maintain a competitive advantage relies heavily on attracting and retaining highly
qualified professionals in fields where we operate to continuously innovate and iterate
our existing products and expand our emerging business. However, the competition for
such talent is intense, and there is a risk that we may not be able to recruit or retain the
necessary personnel to support our growth and international expansion strategies.


-----

Additionally, our key management and employees are subject to confidentiality
terms and non-compete arrangements. However, we cannot guarantee that such terms or
arrangements can be fully and legally enforced. The loss of key personnel or the inability
to attract new talent could result in a loss of institutional knowledge and expertise,
adversely affecting our business operations and future prospects. Failure to address these
challenges may negatively impact our business performance, financial condition and our
ability to achieve strategic objectives in the rapidly evolving technology sector.

**Our historical results may not be indicative of our future business, financial condition**
**and results of operations, and we may not be able to manage future growth effectively.**

The historical financial information included in this document is not expected to be
indicative of our future financial results. Such financial information is not intended to
represent or predict the results of operations of any future years/periods. Our future
growth is, to a certain extent, based upon our forward-looking assessment of market
prospects. We cannot guarantee that our assessment will always turn out to be correct or
that we can grow our business as planned. Our expansion plans may be affected by a
number of factors beyond our control. Such factors include changes in the general
economic conditions and the competitive landscape of the industries where we operate, as
well as the relevant regulations and policies and the supply and demand for our products.

Managing our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of
resources. We need to effectively manage our growth and maintain profits as we expect
our costs and expenses may possibly continue to increase in the future. We will also need
to expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce and manage our relationships with
suppliers, customers and other business partners. We also expect to continue to invest in
our current and planned production expansion projects as well as R&D activities. All these
endeavors entail risks and demand considerable management efforts, skills and
significant additional expenditures, which could strain our capacity to enhance our
operational, auditing, human resources, financial and management controls. If we fail to
achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as we grow, our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely
affected.

**As our global business expands, we face various risks associated with our international**
**operations and compliance, and our inability to effectively manage and contain them**
**could adversely affect our business and performance.**

We have established a global manufacturing and sales network. Our global sales
and marketing network spans across Europe, Americas and Asia. We have set up our
major overseas manufacturing base in the Republic of Serbia. As of the Latest Practicable
Date, we also had overseas subsidiaries located in Germany, the Republic of Serbia, Japan,
Mexico and United States. In line with our strategies, we intend to continue to expand our
international operations in the coming years. The demand for and market acceptance of
our products marketed and sold abroad are subject to uncertainty and can be heavily
influenced by local conditions and customs tariff policies. In addition, overseas
investments by PRC companies are also subject to various approvals, filings, reports,


-----

registrations or other procedures from the NDRC, the MOFCOM, the SAFE and other PRC
regulatory authorities. The following sets forth some of the risks associated with our
international operations:

-  difficulties in dealing with regulatory regimes, regulatory bodies and
government policies, in order to obtain or maintain permits, licenses,
approvals and filings/registrations necessary to manufacture, market and sell
our products in or to various countries or jurisdictions;

-  challenges in commercializing our products in new markets where we have
limited experience with the local market dynamics and no existing or
developed sales and marketing infrastructure;

-  challenges in providing products and customer support, in recruiting
personnel in international markets and in managing sales channels
effectively;

-  adverse changes in, our potential failure or the potential failure of our
suppliers or customers to comply with customs laws, regulations, tariffs,
trade policies and quotas set by the local government when we import raw
materials and components or export our products among the different
countries or jurisdictions where we do business;

-  potentially reduced protection for our intellectual property rights and
potential breach of third-party intellectual property rights;

-  differences in accounting treatment in different countries and jurisdictions,
uncertainties in interpretation and application of tax laws and regulations,
more onerous tax obligations and unfavorable tax conditions and foreign
exchange losses;

-  exposure to litigation or third-party claims in different jurisdictions and
inability to effectively enforce contractual or legal rights;

-  changes in laws, regulations and policies as well as political, economic and
market instability, geopolitical risks or civil unrest in the relevant countries
and jurisdictions; and

-  unfavorable market conditions, intense competition, unattractive products
and services, downward pressure on our selling price and any other inherent
risks associated with our international business operations.

Failure to timely address any of the foregoing risks or timely complete such
procedures with respect to overseas operations in the course of our overseas expansion
may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operations and prospects.
Especially, our operations are governed by relevant laws and regulations in the PRC and
other jurisdictions where we operate relating to production safety, product quality and
environmental protection, among other things.


-----

In addition, we may be subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money
laundering, financial and economic sanctions, governmental import or export controls
and similar laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we conduct activities.
Our policies and procedures instituted may not be sufficient and if any of our directors,
officers, employees, representatives, consultants, agents and business partners engaged in
any improper conduct, we may be held responsible. Non-compliance with
anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, financial and economic sanctions
laws or governmental import or export controls could subject us to whistleblower
complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations and severe administrative, civil and
criminal sanctions, collateral consequences, remedial measures and legal expenses, all of
which could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition
and results of operations.

**We rely on the stability of our supply chain as well as a number of suppliers.**

Our success depends in part on our ability to manage our supply chain to
manufacture and deliver our products in a timely manner and with quality. We source the
raw materials and components for our products from third-party suppliers. In 2023 and
2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2025, our raw
materials and consumables used were RMB6,626.8 million, RMB8,901.8 million,
RMB6,162.3 million and RMB7,259.3 million, respectively, representing 81.3%, 83.0%,
82.2% and 84.0% of our total cost of sales, respectively. See “Financial Information —
Description of Major Components of Our Results of Operations — Cost of Sales.” As a
result, our production volume and production costs depend on our ability to source raw
materials and components at competitive prices. However, the raw materials and
components we use are subject to price volatility caused by external factors, such as
commodity price fluctuations, changes in supply and demand, logistics and processing
costs, our bargaining power with suppliers, inflation, governmental regulations and
policies, geopolitical tensions or health epidemics. There can be no assurances that the
price of our raw materials will not significantly increase or fluctuate in the future.
Therefore, we might fail to secure an adequate supply of such raw materials and
components under favorable business conditions as required by us, if at all, which could
prevent us from meeting our customer demand. Moreover, such shortage could lead to
increases in material cost and negatively impact our future profitability.

In addition, our suppliers could fail to meet our needs for various reasons beyond
our control, including fires, natural disasters, extreme weather, manufacturing problems,
epidemic, strikes, transportation interruptions or governmental regulation. A failure of
supply could also occur due to suppliers’ financial difficulties, including bankruptcy.
Changing suppliers may require a long lead time. We may not be able to locate alternative
suppliers in sufficient quantities, of suitable quality or at an acceptable price within a
reasonable period of time, or at all. As a result, our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.


-----

**Pricing pressure from our customers may materially and adversely affect our business,**
**financial condition and results of operations.**

We design, develop and manufacture complex and quality products, and primarily
supply to automotive manufacturers in automotive industry. It’s a common practice in the
industry for automotive manufactures to renegotiate a lowered price for existing vehicle
models annually with their suppliers, and the competition in our industry will also affect
our bargaining power on pricing. Our customers’ purchase orders generally require
step-downs in component pricing over the period of production, and the pricing scheme is
normally renegotiated annually, which will reflect the pricing trends in the industry. Our
automotive manufacturer customers also have significant leverage over their suppliers,
including us, because our industry is relatively competitive. Prices may also be adjusted
to reflect changes in product content/costs and other commercial factors. If automotive
manufacturers continue to implement cost-reduction measures, the pricing pressure on us
as their supplier may intensify beyond our expectations. Our financial performance is
largely dependent on our ability to adjust our pricing model accordingly and achieve
product cost controls through product design enhancements, supply chain management
and manufacturing efficiencies actions. We also seek to enhance our financial performance
by investing in product development, design capabilities and new product initiatives that
respond to and anticipate the needs of our customers and consumers. We continually
evaluate operational and strategic alternatives to improve our business structure and
align our business with the changing needs of our customers and major industry trends
affecting our business. Our inability to maintain our gross margin and achieve product
cost controls that offset customer-imposed or market influenced price reductions could
adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**We may not be successful in implementing our business plans and strategies effectively**
**or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition**
**and results of operations.**

Our business plans and strategies are based on our assumptions of future events
which may entail certain risks and are inherently subject to uncertainties. These
assumptions may not be correct, which could affect the commercial viability of our
business plans and strategies. As such, we cannot guarantee that our business plans and
strategies will be implemented successfully as scheduled or at all.

We may seek to expand our business through cooperation, strategic investments,
mergers and acquisitions and partnership in the future. The success of these endeavors
depends on the availability of, and competition for, suitable targets and opportunities, as
well as financial resources, including available cash and financing capacity. If we fail to
implement our business plans and strategies effectively and efficiently, we may be unable
to expand our operations, manage our growth, take advantage of market opportunities as
expected or remain competitive in the industry. Moreover, future cooperations, strategic
investments, mergers and acquisitions and partnerships may expose us to potential risks,
including the diversion of management attention and resources from our existing
business and the inability to generate sufficient income to offset the costs and expenses.
These endeavors may also result in an increased leverage, sharing of potential legal
liabilities in respect of the target businesses, and increased impairment charges related to


-----

goodwill and other intangible assets. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able
to achieve the strategic purpose of any investment, partnership or cooperation, the
desired level of control in management decisions of the partnership or our anticipated
investment return from such business expansion. If we are unable to implement our
expansion plans effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations
may be materially and adversely affected.

**Changes in regulations, international trade policies, tariffs and rising political**
**tensions, may adversely impact our business and operating results.**

Due to the interconnectedness of the global economy, policy changes in one area of
the world can have an immediate and material adverse impact on markets around the
world. Significant political, trade or regulatory changes in the jurisdictions in which we
operate or sell products, such as those stemming from the current U.S. federal
administration, are difficult to predict and may have a material adverse effect on us. For
example, changes to tariff policy implemented by the U.S. Congress, the Trump
administration or any new administration have impacted and may in the future impact,
among other things, the U.S. and global economy, international trade relations, the U.S.
regulatory environment, inflation and other areas; the European Union has also
implemented certain tariffs on Chinese-made electronic vehicles, which could adversely
impact the competitiveness of our customers in the EU market.

Rising political tensions as a result of trade policies could reduce trade volume,
investment and other economic activities between major international economies. These
developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material
adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets,
which in turn can significantly impact our business and results of operations.
Consequently, such developments necessitate our increased investments in monitoring
policy developments and exploring strategies to mitigate the impact on our operations.
Economic sanctions and trade restriction measures (including tariffs) taken by
government authorities or other trade tensions or unfavorable trade policies may affect
the costs and/or marketability of our products, as, without the impact of additional
tariffs, the peers in other countries and regions which are not subject to such tariffs, could
potentially gain market share and improve their price competitiveness. The current
international trade tensions and political tensions and any escalation of such tensions,
may have a material negative impact on our ability to continue to sell to global customers
and further grow our customer base. In addition, as our business is closely interrelated
with the performance of our customers’ end-use products in the marketplace, if our
customers are impacted by restrictive measures of trade protection or export control, our
performance and income will be adversely affected. Geopolitical conditions may also lead
to heightened restrictions on foreign investments, technological exchange, introducing
increased compliance requirements and uncertainty for investors. Any of these factors
could have a material adverse effect on our and our customers’ business, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.

**Our manufacturing processes are potentially vulnerable to disruptions that can**
**increase our production costs. There are uncertainties and risks on whether we may**
**maintain optimal utilization of our production facilities and to expand our production**
**capacity in a cost-effective manner.**

We produce many products and components of products at our production
facilities. We plan to continuously adjust our manufacturing capacity to market demand
and to improve our productivity. Our production operations involve mainly the
coordination of raw materials, inventory management, internal production processes,
logistics and external sales processes. We may experience difficulties in coordinating the
various aspects of our production processes, thereby causing downtime and delays. We
produce and store almost all our products, as well as conduct our development activities,
at our own facilities. A delay or stoppage of production caused by mechanical fault,
adverse weather, natural disaster or other unanticipated catastrophic event, could
significantly impair our ability to produce our products and operate our business. For
example, defaults or defects related to our facilities or machineries and equipment may
result in difficulties to replace with appropriate alternative solutions, catastrophic events
may also destroy any inventory stored in our facilities. The occurrence of any production
interruption or incident may affect our business materially and adversely. Any stoppage
in production, even if temporary, or delay in delivery to our customers could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our continued success is attributable to our ability to manufacture products in a
cost-effective manner, which in turn depends on our ability to accurately forecast
customer demand and maintain optimal utilization of our production facilities, as well as
to effectively expand our production capacity to achieve economies of scale and enhance
production efficiency. Our ability in optimizing our production capacity, however, is
subject to risks and uncertainties which are beyond our control, including fluctuations in
market demand for our products, rise in cost of establishment of manufacturing bases and
delays in construction schedule. Failure in mitigating such risks may incur additional
production costs and lead to an increase in our operation costs. In addition, our expansion
in production capacity requires substantial capital investments and time costs, which may
affect our liquidity and hinder our ability to deliver products in a timely manner.

In addition, there are risks that an accident may occur in any one of our facilities. An
accident may result in destruction of property or equipment, environmental damage,
manufacturing or delivery delays, or may lead to suspension of our operations and
imposition of liabilities. Any such accident may result in litigation, the outcome of which
is difficult to assess or quantify, and the cost to defend such litigation can be significant.
As a result, the costs to defend any action, or the potential liability resulting from any such
accident or arising out of any other litigation and any negative publicity associated
therewith, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.


-----

**If we fail to maintain an effective quality management system, particularly during the**
**production expansion, our business, reputation, financial condition and results of**
**operations may be adversely affected.**

Our product quality is critical to our success. Although we have established a
stringent quality management system, it may not always identify latent product defects,
which could lead to failures during assembly or use, resulting in safety hazards or
operational issues for our customers. The effectiveness of our quality management system
depends on a number of factors, including the design of the system, the machineries used,
the quality of our staff and related training programs and our ability to ensure that our
employees adhere to our quality management policies and guidelines. In the event that
the use of end-products that adopt our products results in an unsafe condition or injury as
a result of, among other factors, our component failures, manufacturing flaws, design
defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or information, it could result in
product liability or warranty claims; we could be named as a defendant in such claims,
and any insurance that we carry may not be sufficient or it may not apply to all situations.
Similarly, our customers could be subjected to claims as a result of such accidents and
bring claims against us to hold us accountable. In addition, in the event that our products
fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results in a recall, our
reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products
to existing and prospective customers and could materially and adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

We are required to comply with specific guidelines based on product safety and
restricted and hazardous materials laws and regulations that are applicable in the
jurisdictions into which our customers sell their products. Our safety standards for the
inspection of our products are also based on relevant national and industry standards.
There can be no assurance that our quality management system will continue to be
effective and in compliance with relevant laws, regulations and standards. Any significant
failure in, or deterioration of the efficacy of, our quality management system could result
in us losing accreditations and requisite certifications or qualifications, which could in
turn have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.

The scale up in our production to meet increasing demand can put pressure on our
quality assurance processes. For example, it may stretch existing resources, including
personnel and equipment, beyond their optimal capacity, leading to potential oversights
or errors. Bottlenecks may occur as quality assurance processes struggle to handle higher
volumes without delays or rushed evaluations. Increased production can also cause
accelerated wear and tear on equipment, affecting product quality. Scaling up may
involve process changes or new technologies, introducing unforeseen quality issues.
Additionally, sourcing additional materials or components to meet higher demand can
result in variability in quality, impacting the final product. These challenges collectively
increase the risk of defects or non-compliance with standards.


-----

**Undetected defects, errors or bugs of our products could adversely affect our business,**
**financial condition and results of operations.**

Most of our products are sold to automotive manufacturers for deployment in their
specific vehicle models. The products we develop are technical and complex, requiring
rigorous standards. They may contain errors, defects, security vulnerabilities or software
issues difficult to detect and correct. Any real or perceived error, defect, security
vulnerability, service interruption or software issue in our products may weaken customer
confidence and trust in our products and result in even losses to our automotive
manufacturer customers. Our product quality programs and processes may not be
sufficient to avoid product failures, which could cause us to lose operating revenue, incur
increased costs such as warranty expenses and costs associated with customer support,
experience delays, cancellations or rescheduling of orders for our products, experience
increased product returns or discounts, or damage our reputation. Our efforts to address
the issues identified in our products may not be timely to meet our automotive
manufacturer customers’ expectations and may disrupt our production. In such an event,
we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to allocate
additional resources to correct the problem. Furthermore, these issues could potentially
lead to complaints, liability claims or lawsuits, including those filed against us by
automotive manufacturer and users or other parties, exposing us to potential liabilities
and damages. There may also be subsequent negative publicity associated with litigation
or negative user experience, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we
are ultimately found liable. As a result, our customer satisfaction could be diminished, our
reputation and brand could be significantly harmed, and our business, financial condition
and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Potential flaws and defects in our design and production processes, or in those of
our suppliers, as well as unsatisfactory performance of our products, could give rise to
product recall incidents. We cannot guarantee that we will not experience any material
losses or expenses related to product liability or product recall incidents or that we will
not incur significant costs to defend any such claims. These actions and incidents could
also expose us to adverse publicity, which might adversely affect our brand, reputation
and customers’ preference for our products. Certain product liability claims may be the
result of defects from component and parts from our suppliers, in the event of which, our
attempt to enforce our rights against such suppliers and manufacturers may be extensive
and time-consuming. For example, a successful product liability claim against us could
require us to pay substantial monetary compensation and may generate substantial
negative publicity about our business. Any insurance coverage might not be sufficient to
cover all potential claims.

In addition, if flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to
occur, we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant
delays in delivery and product rework or replacement costs. Any recall claim brought
against us arising from our products due to a long product life cycle, or any product
liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain, maintain, update or renew all the**
**requisite licenses, permits, certificates and approvals required under the regulatory**
**environment applicable to our business.**

In accordance with the laws and regulations applicable to our operation, we have
obtained and maintained various approvals, licenses, permits and certifications in order
to operate our business. See “Business — Licenses and Approvals” for details. Complying
with such laws and regulations may require substantial expense and impose burdens to
us, while any non-compliance may expose us to liability. Furthermore, with the
introduction and enactment of new laws and regulations, as well as the refinement of
interpretations and applications of existing ones, we cannot guarantee that we will always
be able to maintain or obtain all requisite approvals, licenses, permits and certifications in
a timely manner.

In addition, in the event that we are required to renew our certain existing licenses
or permits or acquire new ones, whether as a result of the promulgation of new laws and
regulations or otherwise, there is no assurance that we will be able to meet the requisite
conditions and requirements, or obtain all requisite approvals, licenses, permits and
certifications in a timely manner. Furthermore, due to the evolving interpretation and
implementation of existing laws and the adoption of additional laws and regulations, the
licenses, permits, qualifications, registrations or filings we hold may be deemed
insufficient by the competent government authorities. If we are unable to obtain, or
experience material delays in obtaining, necessary government approvals, our operations
may be substantially disrupted, and we may be subject to fines or penalties from local
authorities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**Maintaining our brand image is critical to our success, and any failure to do so could**
**severely damage our reputation and brands, which would have a material adverse effect**
**on our business, financial condition and results of operations.**

We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is of significant importance
to the success of our business. Well-recognized brands are important to enhancing our
attractiveness to our customers. Since we operate globally in a relatively competitive
market, brand maintenance and enhancement directly affect our ability to maintain our
market position. The successful promotion of our brand will depend on the effectiveness
of our marketing efforts and amount of word-of-mouth referrals we received from
satisfied customers. We may incur extra expenses in promoting our brand. However, we
cannot guarantee that these activities are and will be successful or that we can achieve the
brand promotion effect we expect.

Our brands, reputation and product sales could be harmed if, for example, our
products fail to meet the expectations of our customers or contain defects or fail. In
addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our
reputation and brand image, undermine customer confidence in us and reduce long-term
demand for our products.


-----

In addition, negative publicity and allegations involving us, our shareholders,
Directors, officers, employees and business partners, or the industry in which we operate
as a whole may materially and adversely harm our brand image and reputation and cause
deterioration in the level of market recognition of and trust in the products provided by
us, thereby resulting in reduced sales volumes and revenues, potential loss of business
partners as well as the loss of highly qualified personnel with specialized skills. In
addition, such negative publicity may come from malicious harassment or unfair
competition acts by third parties, which are beyond our control. Such negative publicity
may also result in the diversion of management’s attention, and governmental
investigations or other forms of scrutiny, which may have a material and adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**The development cycles of our products can be long and we are subject to risks relating**
**to the planning and implementation of complex projects.**

Our planning and implementation process is complex and run throughout the entire
vehicle development cycle, covering numerous stages such as styling design, digital
modelling, tooling and mould development, prototype trial production, testing and
validation, OTS approval, trial production and PPAP. The development cycles of our
products can be lengthy with significant upfront investment. The development cycle for
single project normally vary between 12 to 30 months. In addition, there may be various
challenges during our development process, including, in particular, technical or process
handling issues. As a result, we may face additional expenses and increased quality risks.
If we are unable to resolve these issues, the development of that product may fail and our
business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Further, even where we are nominated as a supplier for a particular vehicle model
and undertake project development accordingly automotive manufacturer generally do
not commit to minimum purchase quantities from their suppliers, nor do they commit that
the products under the relevant R&D projects will ultimately be commercialized. Whether
such projects can be commercialized and mass-produced is often subject to the automotive
manufacturer’s commercialization plans for the relevant vehicle model and changes in its
practical requirements. As such, we cannot guarantee that we may successfully
commercialize such development results of each project on a timely basis, nor can we
guarantee that such commercialization will achieve favourable profit margins, failure of
which may adversely affect on our profitability, and there is a risk that the initial
investment for development cannot be recouped.

**We may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or**
**prevent unauthorized parties from copying or reverse engineering our products, and**
**such efforts to defend and protect our intellectual property may be costly.**

The success of our products and our business depends in part on our ability to
obtain patents and other intellectual property rights and maintain adequate legal
protection for our products in the jurisdictions where we operate. We rely on a
combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and laws related to intellectual property in
China and other countries to establish and protect our proprietary rights, and yet all of
which may provide only limited protection.


-----

We cannot assure you that patents will be granted with respect to our currently
pending patent applications in a manner that gives us adequate defensive protection or
competitive advantages, or that any patent granted to us will not be challenged,
invalidated or circumvented. Our currently granted patents and any patents that may be
granted or registered in the future may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may
not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. We cannot assure you
that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology or the
reverse engineering of our technology. The confidentiality procedures and contractual
restrictions implemented by us may not be sufficient or effective.

Protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other
proprietary technology is expensive and difficult, particularly internationally.
Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or reverse engineer our technologies or certain
aspects of our products that we consider proprietary. Litigation may be necessary in the
future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to prevent unauthorized
parties from copying or reverse engineering our products, to determine the validity and
scope of our proprietary rights or to block infringing products where we operate. Any
such litigation, whether initiated by us or a third party, could result in substantial costs
and diversion of management resources, either of which could adversely affect our
business, operating results and financial condition. Even if we obtain favorable outcomes
in litigation, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies.

**We may face claims of infringement on know-how and intellectual property rights by**
**third parties which, if resolved unfavorably, could result in adverse effect to our**
**business.**

The industry in which our business operates is characterized by a large number of
patents, some of which may be of questionable scope, validity or enforceability. We have
established dedicated intellectual property management mechanisms and internal
controls to minimize the risk of non-compliance and infringement in our use of
intellectual property. However, there is a significant amount of uncertainty in the industry
regarding patent protection and infringement, and we cannot be certain that the
mechanisms we have adopted will eliminate all intellectual property risks, nor can we be
certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe, misappropriate or
otherwise violate intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties. We could
become subject to claims and litigation alleging infringement by us of third-party patents,
copyrights or trade secrets. For example, in the event that our employees, due to their
individual non-compliant conduct, actually use unauthorized software, or in the event
that we recruit employees from other technology companies, including certain potential
competitors, and these employees used or alleged to have used certain know-how,
technology or contents, or the participation by such employees in our research and
development, we may become subject to claims. These claims and any resulting lawsuits,
if resolved adversely to us, could subject us to significant liability for damages, impose
temporary or permanent injunctions against the portions of our business operations that
are subject to the relevant infringement disputes, or invalidate or render unenforceable
our intellectual property rights. An adverse judgment could also result in loss of
reputation or may force us to take costly remediation actions, such as redesigning our
products. In addition, because patent applications can take many years until the patents


-----

issue, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware, possibly resulting
in accidental infringement. If we infringes a valid and enforceable patent, or if we wish to
avoid potential intellectual property litigation on any alleged infringement of our
solutions, we could be prevented from selling, or elect not to sell, our products unless we
obtain a license, which may be unavailable or be available only at commercially
unreasonable, unfavorable or otherwise unacceptable terms. Alternatively, we could be
forced to pay substantial royalties or to redesign one or more of our solutions to avoid any
infringement or allegations thereof. Additionally, we may face liability to our customers,
business partners or third parties for indemnification or other remedies in the event that
they are sued for infringement in connection with their use of our solutions.

We also may not be successful in any attempt to redesign our products to avoid any
alleged infringement. A successful claim of infringement against us, or our failure or
inability to develop and implement non-infringing technology, or license the infringed
technology, on acceptable terms and on a timely basis, could materially adversely affect
our business and results of operations. Furthermore, such lawsuits, regardless of their
success, could likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and may divert
management’s time and attention from our business, which could seriously harm our
business. Also, such lawsuits, regardless of their success, could seriously harm our
reputation with our suppliers and in the industry at large.

**Our patent applications may not be issued as patents, which may have a material**
**adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting solutions**
**similar to ours.**

We cannot be certain that we are the first inventor of the subject matter for which we
have filed a particular patent application, or if we are the first party to file such a patent
application. If another party has filed a patent application covering the same subject
matter as we have developed, and such application has priority against our patent
application, we may not be entitled to the protection sought by our patent application,
including preventing third parties from commercializing the same or similar technologies.
Further, the scope of protection of patent claims may be limited or narrowed if the
examining authority determines there is cause to do so, such as if claims included in the
patent application cover subject matter that is ineligible for patent protection or is
obvious, or are deemed to lack sufficient detail to enable practicing the invention or in the
event of the existence of prior art. As a result, we cannot be certain that the patent
applications that we file will result in issued patents, or that our issued patents will be
broad enough to protect our technology or otherwise afford protection against
competitors with similar technology. In addition, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive
as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability. Our competitors may challenge or
seek to invalidate our issued patents, or design around our issued patents, which may
adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results. Also, the
costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other
intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable.


-----

**Changes in patent law and regulations could diminish the value of patents in general,**
**thereby impairing our ability to protect our technologies.**

The scope of patent protection in various jurisdictions is uncertain. Changes in
either the patent laws or their interpretation in countries and regions where we operate
may diminish our ability to protect our inventions, obtain, maintain, defend and enforce
our intellectual property rights and, more generally, could affect the value of our
intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent rights. We cannot predict whether
the patent applications we are currently pursuing and may pursue in the future will issue
as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any future granted
patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors. The coverage claimed in a
patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope
can be reinterpreted after issuance.

Even if patent applications that we own currently or in the future issue as patents,
they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent
competitors or other third parties from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with
any competitive advantage. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and
commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.

**In addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology,**
**trade secrets, processes and know-how as well as our copyrights in our production and**
**operation process.**

We generally seek to protect our proprietary information (such as trade secrets,
know-how and confidential information) by entering into confidentiality agreements, or
consulting, services or employment agreements that contain non-disclosure and non-use
provisions with our employees, consultants, contractors, scientific advisers and third
parties. However, we may fail to enter into the necessary protective agreements, and even
if entered into, these agreements may be breached or may otherwise fail to prevent
disclosure, third-party infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary information,
may be limited as to their term and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of
unauthorized disclosure or use of proprietary information. We have limited control over
the protection of trade secrets used by our third-party manufacturers and partners and
could lose future trade secret protection if any unauthorized disclosure of such
information occurs. In addition, our proprietary information may otherwise become
known or be independently developed by our competitors or other third parties. To the
extent that our employees, consultants, contractors, scientific advisers and other third
parties use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise
as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Costly and
time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our
proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain protection for our proprietary
information could adversely affect our competitive business position.

However, we cannot assure you that such measures will be effective in mitigating
the relevant risks or completely preventing intellectual property disputes or competition
from arising.


-----

We also rely on physical and electronic security measures to protect our proprietary
information, but we cannot provide assurance that these security measures will not be
breached or provide adequate protection for our property. There is a risk that third parties
may obtain and improperly utilize our proprietary information to our competitive
disadvantage. We may not be able to detect or prevent the unauthorized use of such
information or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property
rights.

**We rely on our business partners and other industry participants and the business**
**collaboration with them is subject to various risks.**

Strategic business relationships are, and will continue to be, an important factor in
the growth and success of our business. We have alliances and partnerships with other
industry participants, such as research centers. If we are unable to maintain the existing
relationships with our business partners, or if we fail to identify and negotiate additional
relationships that are essential to our future expansion or success on commercially
acceptable terms or at all, we may incur increased costs to develop and provide these
capabilities on our own, and our business, financial condition and results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected. We could experience delays in the
development or delivery of our products to the extent our partners do not meet agreed
timelines or experience capacity constraints. We could also experience disagreement in
budget or funding for any joint development project. There is also risk of potential
disputes with partners in the future, including with respect to intellectual property rights.
Moreover, if our existing partner agreements were to be terminated, we may be unable to
timely secure alternative agreements on terms and conditions commercially acceptable to
us. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**We are exposed to credit risks related to our trade and bills receivables, deposits and**
**other receivables.**

We face credit risks attributable to our trade and bills receivables, deposits and
other receivables. Our trade and bills receivables in 2023, 2024 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2025 amounted to RMB4,398.1 million, RMB6,108.9 million and RMB6,250.0
million, respectively. In the relevant years/periods, our average trade receivable turnover
days were 77 days, 103 days and 105 days respectively.

The fluctuation and extension of trade and bills receivables turnover may have a
material and adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity position. See “Financial
Information — Discussion of Certain Components from our Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position — Trade and Bills Receivables” for details. Additionally, our deposits
and other receivables, less allowance for credit loss in 2023 and 2024 and the nine months
ended September 30, 2025, amounted to RMB3.6 million, RMB2.2 million and RMB5.0
million, respectively. We have dedicated personnel responsible for trade and bills
receivables, as well as deposits and other receivables. We cannot assure you that all of our
counterparties will not default on us in the future, despite our efforts to conduct credit
assessments on them. As a result, we are exposed to risks that our counterparties may fail
to fulfill their obligations to us under our contracts.


-----

Pursuant to the Labor Contract Law, dispatched labor is intended to be a
supplementary form of employment and the fundamental form should be direct
employment by enterprises and organizations that hire employees. Further, it is stated in
the Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatch (《勞務派遣暫行規定》) that became effective on
March 1, 2014 that the number of dispatched workers an employer uses may not exceed
10% of its total labor force. During the Track Record Period, dispatched workers of our
Company and certain PRC subsidiaries exceeded 10% of the total labor force. During the
Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we had not received any notice
of rectification from, or been imposed any administrative penalty by, the relevant
governmental authorities in this regard. However, we cannot assure you that the
competent authorities will not request us to rectify such arrangements within a prescribed
period. If we fails to rectify within the prescribed period, it may be subject to a fine
ranging from RMB5,000 to RMB10,000 per excess dispatched worker.

**Failure to pay social insurance and housing provident funds for our employees in**
**accordance with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to penalties.**

We are subject to PRC labour laws and regulations and are required to make
contributions for our employees to various social welfare schemes, including the housing
provident fund, pension insurance, medical insurance, unemployment insurance,
maternity insurance and work-related injury insurance. The relevant authorities may
inspect an employer’s compliance, and any failure to make full contributions in
accordance with applicable requirements may result in administrative penalties. During
the Track Record Period, we did not make full social insurance and housing provident
fund contributions for certain employees in accordance with applicable local
requirements, or arranged for certain employees’ contributions to be made through
third-party agencies. During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable
Date, we had not received any warning notice from the relevant authorities in this regard,
nor were we subject to any administrative penalties or other disciplinary actions, and
none of our employees had made or brought any collective complaints or whistleblowing
reports. As advised by our PRC legal advisor, assuming there are no material changes in
the applicable policies, laws and regulations and local enforcement requirements relating
to social insurance and housing provident fund contributions, and there are no employee
collective complaints or reports, the risk of us being subject to centralized collection of
contributions payment or material administrative penalties in respect of the above
matters is relatively low. However, we cannot assure you that the competent authorities
will not require us to pay any underpaid contributions and impose late payment
surcharges or fines. If we are investigated or subject to material administrative penalties,
or incur material legal costs, due to non-compliance with relevant PRC laws and
regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected.


-----

**Our production is dependent on the stable, timely and adequate supply of energy at**
**reasonable prices.**

We depend on a stable supply of energy, mainly including electricity and water, to
maintain production. Our production volume and manufacturing costs are affected by the
price and supply of energy. The prices of energy are subject to a number of factors which
may be beyond our control, including inflation, supplier capacity constraints, general
economic conditions, commodity price fluctuations, demand from other industries for
energy and local and national regulatory requirements. Furthermore, there can be no
assurance that unexpected and serious shortages of energy will not occur in the future or
that we will be able to pass on any cost increases to our customers. Adverse changes in
power consumption policies, particularly those leading to higher energy prices, could
negatively impact our business, financial condition, operational results and prospects.
Significant fluctuations in these costs could materially affect our profitability if we are
unable to adjust our product prices accordingly, potentially undermining our competitive
advantages. Failure to pass increased costs onto our customers may lead to a reduction in
our profit margins. If the supply of energy is affected by natural disasters, adverse
weather conditions, equipment failures, disruptions in transport or other inclement
factors, we may not be able to locate alternative sources of supply at commercially
reasonable prices or maintain the full energy supply required for production, resulting the
reduction or cessation of production capacity. Any such events may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Our existing automotive manufacturer customers may not purchase our products in any**
**certain quantity or at any certain price.**

Upon obtaining nomination from certain automotive manufacturer, we develop
customized solutions to be equipped on specific vehicle models of automotive
manufacturer customers. We generally enter into procurement general terms or master
contracts with our automotive manufacturer customers, which set forth the general and
salient terms such as general product range, individual contract and/or order placement
principals, technology standards, qualification and warranty requirements, delivery
principals, indemnifications and general terms. For details such as purchasing quantity,
pricing, our automotive manufacturer customers may provide estimations based on their
production plan of relevant vehicle models, and will enter into individual contracts or
place procurement orders specifying the pricing with us from time to time, and the
automotive manufacturer may reserve the right of potential adjustment of the purchase
volumes and delivery arrangement, which may result in uncertainty to our revenue.
Additionally, automotive manufacturer may experience delays or cancellations in the
development of the models, which may result in extended timelines or even the
abandonment of certain models. As a result, in case actual production orders from the
automotive manufacturer customers are not consistent with their projections, or even if
mass production commences but the orders placed with us and the prices offered to us
differ materially, we could realize less revenue than our expectation. If actual production
orders or sales volumes are lower than estimated, we may not cancel excess supplies in a
timely manner, or at all, and the inventory may accumulate, leading to increased storage
costs and potential obsolescence, which may materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**We have certain construction projects which require substantial upfront investment**
**and involve long construction years/periods. Without prudent project selection and**
**effective risk management, our business, financial condition and results of operations**
**may be adversely affected.**

We currently have several construction in process projects, such as the electronics
facility of the Intelligent Manufacturing Industrial Park and the intelligent automotive
electronics and vision systems industrial center project. The construction and operation of
such projects may require substantial upfront capital and resources during the early
stages of project development. The successful completion of such projects is subject to
several factors beyond our control, including but not limited to regulatory approval,
climate conditions, and supply chain condition. Any delay or disruption in these
processes may result in cost overruns, project postponements or cancellations, which
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, the long payback period associated with these capital-intensive projects
may impact our liquidity and profitability. We cannot assure you that we will always
accurately assess project feasibility, manage construction risks or respond promptly to
market changes, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**Any failure to offer high-quality maintenance and after-sales support services for our**
**customers may harm our relationships with them and, consequently, our business.**

As we continue to grow our operations and support our customer base, we need to
be able to continue to provide efficient after-sales support and effective maintenance that
meets our customers’ needs at scale. We may not be able to recruit or retain sufficient
qualified support personnel with experiences in supporting customers of our products. As
a result, we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term
increases in customer demand for technical support or maintenance assistance. We also
may be unable to modify the future scope and delivery of our maintenance services and
technical support to compete with changes in the technical services provided by our
competitors.

If we experience increased customer demand for after-sales support and
maintenance, we may face increased costs that may harm our results of operations. In
particular, we may expand to countries and regions where the costs of providing
maintenance and after-sales support services are higher as a result of more stringent
consumer protection regulations and market practices. If we are unable to provide
efficient customer maintenance and after-sales support, our business may be harmed. Our
ability to attract new end customers is highly dependent on our business reputation and
on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any actual or perceived
failure to maintain high-quality maintenance and after-sales support services would harm
our business.


-----

We cannot guarantee that the local governments and tax authorities will not, in the
future, change their position and discontinue any of the grants and subsidies, or our
current tax treatments. The discontinuation of governmental grants and/or any of our
current tax treatments could adversely impact our net profit.

**Our results of operations were and may continue to be subject to period-to-period**
**fluctuations.**

We have experienced and may continue to experience period-to-period fluctuations
in our results of operations. Historically, we had more sales and production volumes in
the fourth quarter of a given year as compared to the rest of year because our automotive
manufacturer customers tended to deliver more products during the fourth quarter of the
year. In addition, we cannot guarantee against any delay in completion of inspection and
acceptance by our customers. Any slight delays in the customer acceptance of our
products may cause substantial changes in proportion of operational results over different
quarters of the year or even different year. As a result of such fluctuations in our revenue
recognition from period to period, comparisons of revenue and our operating results
between different years/periods within a single financial year are not necessarily
meaningful, nor can these comparisons be relied upon in assessing or predicting our
future financial performance in a particular year or period.

**We may incur significant capital expenditures for our business operations and**
**expansion plans, which may adversely affect our short-term cash flow, liquidity and**
**profitability.**

We may incur significant capital expenditures in connection with our business
operations and expansion plans, including investments in our manufacturing bases to
expand our offerings and upgrade our production technologies. See “Financial
Information — Capital Expenditures.” In 2023 and 2024 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2025, our capital expenditures amounted to RMB1,040.6 million, RMB679.1
million and RMB666.0 million, respectively. Inherent risk exists for such significant
capital expenditures as our investments may not succeed or generate the benefits that we
expect, which could materially affect our profitability. Even if we achieve our goals for
such investments, our short-term cash flow and liquidity may be adversely affected.
While we intend to explore alternative arrangements to reduce the capital intensity of any
future expansion, there is no assurance this will be successful. The markets for certain of
our offerings remain relatively new, and it is uncertain whether our efforts, and related
investments, will result in adequate financial returns for us. Further, our technological
adjustments and upgrades, as well as new products and services, may not be successful.
Any early-stage investments and development of such new products may not result in
long-term success or financial returns for us.


-----

We face inherent risks related to patent disputes and litigation in our business. Such
disputes can divert management’s focus, incur substantial legal costs and damage our
reputation. Unfavorable outcomes could result in financial liabilities, operational
disruptions or restrictions on the use of certain technologies, adversely affecting our
business, financial condition and operational results.

**We are subject to environmental, fire control and health and safety laws, regulations**
**and requirements.**

We are subject to a number of environmental, fire control and health and safety laws
and regulations, including, but not limited to, the treatment and discharge of pollutants
into the environment during our business operations. In addition, our production
facilities and production lines can only be put into operation after the relevant
administrative authorities in charge of environmental protection, fire control have
examined and approved the relevant facilities in China or other jurisdictions.

We may not be fully compliant with these requirements and may experience several
isolated immaterial incidents, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply
with all regulations and obtain all the regulatory approvals required for our production in
a timely manner, or at all. Delays or failures in obtaining all the requisite regulatory
approvals of such facilities may affect our ability to develop, manufacture and
commercialize our products in line with our plans. As requirements imposed by such laws
and regulations may change and more stringent laws or regulations adopted, we may not
be able to comply with, or accurately predict any potential substantial cost of complying
with, these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with relevant laws and regulations,
we may be subject to rectification orders, substantial fines, potentially significant
monetary damages or production suspensions in our business operations. In addition, we
cannot fully eliminate the risk of accidental contamination, biological or chemical hazards
or personal injury at our facilities during the process of testing, developing and
manufacturing our products. In the event of an accident involving a breach of any of these
laws and regulations, we could be held liable for damages and clean-up costs which, to the
extent not covered by existing insurance or indemnification, could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Other adverse effects could result from such
liability, including reputational damage.


-----

cover us for any loss or that we will be able to successfully claim our losses under our
current insurance policy on a timely basis, or at all. If we incur any loss that is not covered
by our insurance policies, or the compensation amount is significantly less than our actual
loss, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected.

**We may be subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to cyber security and data**
**privacy.**

We may be subject to laws and regulations relating to cyber security and data
privacy, including restrictions on the collection, usage and storage of confidential
information. In addition, we may be influenced by misconduct of our employees or third
parties, such as improperly using information obtained in our operations,
misappropriating or illegally disclosing confidential information obtained in our business
operations. As a result, we may be required to invest significant resources to develop our
security measures against cyber security and data privacy issues caused by potential
breaches.

In addition, regulatory requirements on cyber security and data privacy are
constantly evolving and can be subject to varying interpretations or significant changes,
resulting in uncertainties about the scope of our responsibilities in that regard. We cannot
guarantee that relevant interpretation or implementation of the laws or regulations will
not adversely affect us. We may also become subject to new laws and regulations
regarding cyber security and data privacy matters. Failure to comply with the applicable
laws and regulations or effectively address data privacy and protection concerns could
subject us to legal proceedings, regulatory actions or penalties, which may further
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Failure or disruption of our information technology systems could endanger the trust of**
**our customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of**
**operations.**

We have implemented various information technology systems to cover key areas of
our operations. We rely on our information technology systems for the timely delivery of
our products to customers. However, any failure or disruption in the operation of these
systems or the loss of data due to such failure or disruption, including due to human error,
sabotage, cyber attack or any actual or perceived security breach that leads to leakage of
our confidential information, may interrupt our operations, temporarily or permanently
disable our platform, result in fraudulent transfer of funds, damage our relationships with
our customers and other business partners, and subject us to high cost and damages, legal
liabilities, regulatory sanctions, financial exposure and reputational damages, any of
which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.


-----

Furthermore, the unavailability of, or failure to retain, well-trained employees
capable of constantly servicing our information technology systems may lead to
inefficiency or disruption of information technology systems, thereby adversely affecting
our ability to operate efficiently.

**To address any ESG risks, we may incur additional costs, which may materially and**
**adversely affect our financial performance.**

To identify, manage and mitigate ESG risks, we may incur additional costs and
expenses which could impact our financial performance. Nonetheless, we monitor ESG
risks that may impact on our business, strategy and financial performance and evaluate
the magnitude of the resulting impact over the short-, medium- and long-term horizons.
We monitor a wide range of indicators to manage our environmental and climate-related
risks arising from our operations and are committed to providing adequate support to our
employees to nurture a friendly and inspirational corporate culture. This commitment
may entail incurring substantial additional costs and would potentially impact our
profitability. See “Business — Environmental, Social and Governance” for details.

In addition, the increasing ESG-related regulatory requirements, including various
ESG disclosure mandates in the jurisdictions where we operate, may lead to rising
compliance costs. Failure to adapt to new regulations or meet evolving industry
expectations and standards could result in customers choosing products from other
companies, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and
financial conditions.

**Any future occurrence of force majeure events, such as natural disasters, wars or**
**outbreaks of contagious diseases may materially and adversely affect our business,**
**financial condition and results of operations.**

Our business could be adversely affected by natural disasters such as floods,
earthquakes, sandstorms, snowstorms, fire or drought, the outbreak of a widespread
health epidemic or any severe epidemic disease such as SARS, Ebola, Zika or the
COVID-19, acts of war, riots, terrorism or other force majeure events beyond our control.
Any of the foregoing events may give rise to interruptions, damage to our property, delays
in production, breakdowns, system failures, technology platform failures or internet
failures, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects. In particular, these natural disasters, outbreaks of contagious
diseases and other adverse public health developments could severely disrupt our
business operations by damaging our technology infrastructure or information
technology system or impacting the productivity of our workforce, which may adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations.

**RISKS RELATING TO DOING BUSINESS IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE WE**
**OPERATE**

**Uncertainties embedded in the legal systems in the countries and regions where we**
**operate could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.**

We conduct our business primarily through our entities in China. Our operations in
China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. And we have set up our major overseas
manufacturing base in the Republic of Serbia. As of the Latest Practicable Date, we had
overseas subsidiaries located in Germany, the Republic of Serbia, Japan, Mexico and
United States. We also have a subsidiary in Hong Kong. Legal systems of the geographic
markets where we operate vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some
jurisdictions have a civil law system based on written statutes and others are based on
common law. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions under the civil law
system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value.

The legal systems of some geographic markets where we operate are consistently
evolving. Laws and regulations that are recently enacted may not sufficiently cover all
aspects of economic activities in such markets. In particular, the interpretation and
enforcement of these laws and regulations are subject to future implementations, and the
application of some of these laws and regulations to our businesses is not settled. Since
local administrative and court authorities are authorized to interpret and implement
statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of
administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we have in many of
the geographic markets where we operate. Local courts may have discretion to reject
enforcement of foreign awards or arbitration awards. These uncertainties may affect our
judgment on the relevance of legal requirements and our ability to enforce our contractual
rights or claims. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties may be exploited through
unmerited or frivolous legal actions, claims concerning the conduct of third parties, or
threats in attempt to extract payments or benefits from us.

Furthermore, many of the legal systems in the geographic markets where we
operate are based in part on their respective government policies and internal
interpretations, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all and may have
retroactive effects. There are other circumstances where key regulatory definitions are
unclear, imprecise or missing, or where interpretations that are adopted by regulators are
inconsistent with interpretations adopted by a court in analogous cases. As a result, we
may not be aware of our violation of certain policies or rules until sometime after the
violation. In addition, administrative and court proceedings in certain of our geographic
markets may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and
management attention.

It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to
be applicable to us in our geographic markets and elsewhere that could affect our
businesses and operations. Scrutiny and regulations of the industries in which we operate
may further increase, and we may be required to devote additional legal and other
resources to addressing these regulations. Changes in current laws or regulations or the
imposition of new laws and regulations in our geographic markets may slow the growth
of our industries and affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Accordingly, following the completion of the [REDACTED], under existing foreign
exchange regulations, there is no assurance that we may obtain sufficient foreign
currencies to satisfy all of our foreign currency demands. Any insufficiency of foreign
exchange may restrict our ability to obtain sufficient foreign exchange for dividend
payments to shareholders or to satisfy any other foreign exchange requirements, or to
capitalize our capital expenditure plans, and even our business, operating results and
financial condition, may be affected. Further, we cannot guarantee that new regulations
will not be promulgated by Chinese or foreign authorities in the future that would have
the effect of further restricting the remittance of RMB into or out of China.

**We could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new local or overseas tax**
**legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.**

As a company incorporated in the PRC, we are subject to PRC tax laws and
regulations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fully comply with the relevant
tax laws and regulations. Any violation of such laws and regulations may result in fines,
other penalties, actions or litigation, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We also operate in countries and regions overseas and are subject to various taxes
and may be entitled to preferential tax treatment in such jurisdictions. For example, based
on the Corporate Income Tax of Serbia and the investment scale by our Group in the
Republic of Serbia, our subsidiary in Serbia will be entitled to a 10-year exemption of
corporate income tax from the initial profitable year. Due to the fact that the tax
environment and legal framework can vary significantly across jurisdictions and that
regulations regarding various taxes, including but not limited to corporate income tax and
import duties, are highly complex, our overseas operations and expansion may expose us
to risks associated with overseas tax laws, regulations and policies, and there are no
guarantee on continuous preferential tax treatment in different jurisdictions.
Additionally, as we sell our products to various non-domestic markets, the intricacies of
import duty regulations can lead to disputes when exporting products, as interpretations
and applications of such rules may differ between countries. In such cases, we will be
subject to fines or other penalties, which may not always have merit. Due to economic and
political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change.
Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries
with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and
liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Dealing with such regulatory
complexities and changes may require us to divert more managerial and financial
resources, which in turn could affect our results of operations.

We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by
local and overseas tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the
likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the
adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these
examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of
our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial
condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.

**We are a PRC enterprise and we are subject to PRC tax on our global income.**

[REDACTED] may be subject to PRC income taxes for any gains on the sales of H Shares
**and dividends on the H Shares.**

Under the PRC EIT Law and Implementation Regulation of the EIT Law, subject to
any applicable tax treaty or similar arrangement between PRC and a non-PRC investor’s
jurisdiction of residence that provides for a different income tax arrangement, PRC
withholding tax at the rate of 10% is normally applicable to dividends from PRC sources
payable to investors that are non-PRC resident enterprises which do not have an
establishment or place of business in PRC, or which have an establishment or place of
business in PRC but the relevant income is not effectively connected with such
establishment or place of business. Any gains realized on the transfer of Shares by such
investors are subject to a 10% PRC income tax rate if such gains are regarded as income
from sources within PRC unless a treaty or similar arrangement provides otherwise.

Under the PRC Individual Income Tax Law (《中華人民共和國個人所得稅法》) and its
implementation rules, dividends from sources within PRC paid to foreign individual
investors who are not PRC residents are generally subject to a 20% PRC withholding tax
rate, and gains from PRC sources realized by such investors on the transfer of shares are
generally subject to a 20% PRC income tax rate, in each case, subject to any reduction or
exemption under applicable tax treaties and laws in PRC. Pursuant to the Notice on the
Issues Concerning Individual Income Tax Collection and Management after the Repeal of
Guo Shui Fa [1993] No. 045 (《關於國稅發[1993]045號文件廢止後有關個人所得稅徵管問題的
通知》) (Guo Shui Han [2011] No. 348) (國稅函[2011]348號) dated June 28, 2011, issued by
the SAT, dividends paid to non-PRC resident individual holders of H Shares are generally
subject to the individual income tax of PRC at a withholding tax rate of 10%, depends on
whether there are tax arrangements between the jurisdictions where the individual
holders reside, as well as the tax arrangements between PRC and Hong Kong. Non-PRC
resident individual holders who reside in jurisdictions that have not entered into tax
treaties with PRC are subject to a 20% withholding tax on dividends received from us.

If PRC income tax is imposed on gains realized from the transfer of [REDACTED] or
on dividends paid to our non-PRC resident [REDACTED], the value of your

[REDACTED] in [REDACTED] may be affected. Furthermore, our Shareholders whose
jurisdictions of residence have tax treaties or arrangements with PRC may not qualify for
benefits under such tax treaties or arrangements.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE [REDACTED]**

**We will be concurrently subject to [REDACTED] and regulatory requirements of PRC**
**and Hong Kong and the two [REDACTED] markets have different characteristics.**

As we are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and will be [REDACTED] on the
Main Board in Hong Kong, we will be required to comply with the [REDACTED] rules
(where applicable) and other regulatory regimes of both jurisdictions, unless an
exemption is available, or a waiver has been obtained. Accordingly, we may incur
additional costs and resources in continuously complying with all sets of listing rules in
the two jurisdictions. The characteristics of the A share and H share markets may differ.
Our A Shares are listed and traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Following

[REDACTED], our A Shares will continue to be traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange
and our H Shares will be [REDACTED] on the Stock Exchange. Under current laws and
regulations of PRC, without the approval from the relevant regulatory authorities, our H
Shares and A Shares are neither interchangeable nor fungible, and there is no

[REDACTED] between the H Share and A Share markets. With different [REDACTED]
characteristics, the H Share and A Share markets have divergent [REDACTED] volumes,
liquidity and [REDACTED] bases, as well as different levels of retail and institutional

[REDACTED] participation. As a result, the trading performance of our H Shares and A
Shares may not be comparable. Nonetheless, fluctuations in the price of our A Shares may
adversely affect the price of our H Shares, and vice versa. Due to the different
characteristics of the H Share and A Share markets, the historical prices of our A Shares
may not be indicative of the performance of our H Shares. You should therefore not place
undue reliance on the trading history of our A Shares when evaluating the [REDACTED]
decision [REDACTED].

**There has been no prior [REDACTED] for our H Shares, and an active [REDACTED] for**
**our H Shares may not develop or be sustained.**

Prior to the [REDACTED], there was no public market for our H Shares. We cannot
assure you that a [REDACTED] for our H Shares with adequate liquidity and

[REDACTED] volume will develop and be sustained following the completion of the

[REDACTED]. In addition, the [REDACTED] of our H Shares is the result of negotiations
between the [REDACTED] (for itself and on behalf of the [REDACTED]) and us, and may
not be an indication of the [REDACTED] at which our H Shares will be traded following
the completion of the [REDACTED]. If an active [REDACTED] for our H Shares does not
develop following the completion of the [REDACTED], the [REDACTED] and liquidity
of our H Shares may be materially and adversely affected.

**The liquidity, [REDACTED] volume and [REDACTED] of our H Shares following the**

[REDACTED] may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to you.

The [REDACTED] of our H Shares may be subject to significant volatility in
response to various factors beyond our control, including the general market conditions of
the securities in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the world. The Stock Exchange and other
securities markets have, from time to time, experienced significant [REDACTED] and

[REDACTED] volume volatility that are not related to the operating performance of any

[REDACTED] decisions in our H Shares should not be based on any information
**released by us in connection with the listing of our A Shares on the Shanghai Stock**
**Exchange, which were prepared based on regulatory requirements.**

As our A Shares are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, we have been subject to
periodic reporting and other information disclosure requirements in PRC. As a result,
from time to time, we publicly release information relating to us on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange or other media outlets designated by the CSRC. However, the information
announced by us in connection with our A Shares listing is based on regulatory
requirements of the securities authorities, industry standards and market practices in
PRC, which are different from those applicable to the [REDACTED]. The presentation of
financial and operational information for the Track Record Period disclosed on the
Shanghai Stock Exchange or other media outlets may not be directly comparable to the
financial and operational information contained in this document. As a result, prospective

[REDACTED] in our H Shares should be reminded that, in making their [REDACTED]
decisions as to whether to [REDACTED] our H Shares, they should rely only on the
financial, operating and other information included in this document. By applying to

[REDACTED] our H Shares in the [REDACTED], you will be deemed to have agreed that
you will not rely on any information other than that contained in this document and any
formal announcements made by us in Hong Kong with respect to the [REDACTED].

**Certain facts, forecasts and other statistics contained in this results of operations are**
**derived from publicly available official sources.**

Certain facts, forecasts and statistics in this results of operations relating to the PRC
and global economy and the industry in which we operate are obtained from official
government publications or publicly available sources that we believe are reliable.
However, we cannot guarantee the quality or reliability of these sources. Our Directors
believe that the sources of the information are appropriate and have taken reasonable care
in extracting and reproducing such information. They do not believe that such
information is false or misleading or that any material fact has been omitted that would
render such information false or misleading. The information from official government
sources has not been independently verified by our Group, the Sole Sponsor or any other
party involved in the [REDACTED] and no representation is given as to its accuracy or
completeness. Due to possibly flawed or ineffective sampling or discrepancies between
published information and market practice and other problems, the statistics in this
results of operations relating to the PRC and the global economy and the industry in
which we operate may be inaccurate or may not be comparable to statistics produced for
other economies and should not be unduly relied upon. Moreover, these facts, forecasts
and statistics involve risk and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various
factors and should not be unduly relied upon. You should consider how much weight or
importance such facts or statistics carry and should not place undue reliance on them.

**Our historical dividends may not be indicative of our future dividend policy, and there**
**can be no assurance whether and when we will pay dividends in the future.**

We have declared dividends in the past. Our Company declared dividends of
RMB314.2 million, RMB397.3 million and RMB426.5 million in respect of the financial
years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

However, there is no assurance that dividends of any amount will be declared or
distributed by us in any year in the future. Under the applicable laws and regulations of
the PRC, the payment of dividends may be subject to certain limitations, and the
calculation of our profit under the Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises may
differ in certain respects from the calculation under the IFRS Accounting Standards. The
declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends are subject to the discretion of
our Board of Directors, after taking into account various factors, including but not limited
to our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, capital expenditure
requirements, market conditions, our strategic plans and prospects for business
development, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors as our
Board of Directors may deem relevant, and subject to the approval at Shareholders’
meeting. Any declaration and payment as well as the amount of dividends will be subject
to our constitutional documents and the applicable laws and regulations of the PRC and
Hong Kong. For details, see “Financial Information — Dividends and Dividend Policy.”
No dividend shall be declared or payable except out of our profits and reserves lawfully
available for distribution. Our historical dividends should not be taken as indicative of
our dividend policy in the future.

**You should read the entire results of operations carefully and we strongly caution you**
**not to place any reliance on any information contained in press articles or other media**
**regarding us, our Shares or the [REDACTED].**

You are strongly advised to read the entire document carefully and are cautioned
against placing any reliance on the information in any press article or any other media
coverage which contains information not disclosed or not consistent with the information
included in our results of operations. Prior to the completion of the [REDACTED], there
may be press and media coverage regarding our Group and the [REDACTED]. Such press
and media coverage may include references to certain information that does not appear in
this document, including certain operating and financial information and projections,
valuations and other information. Our Directors would like to emphasize to prospective

[REDACTED] that we do not accept any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness
of such information, and such information is not sourced from or authorized by our
Directors or our management team. Our Directors make no representation as to the
appropriateness, accuracy, completeness and reliability of any information or the fairness
or appropriateness of any forecast, view or opinion expressed by the press or other media
regarding our Group or our H Shares. To the extent that any such information is
inconsistent or conflicts with the information contained in this document, we disclaim
responsibility for it and our [REDACTED] should not rely on such information.
