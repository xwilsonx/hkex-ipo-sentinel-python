**PRODUCTION**

As of September 30, 2025, we operated three major manufacturing bases globally,
comprising 12 manufacturing facilities, of which 11 were located in the PRC and one in
Serbia, forming a robust global manufacturing network that enables us to efficiently
supply key automotive markets in Asia, Europe and the Americas. In 2025, we initiated
construction of our planned Chongqing Manufacturing Base, primarily intended to serve
customers in southwestern China, with a focus on producing front and rear lighting
products.

**RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS**

Our principal raw materials include electronic components (such as LEDs, chips,
PCBs, capacitors and resistors), automotive lighting electronic components (such as
wiring harnesses), and resin materials (such as PC, PMMA and PP). As our procurement of
raw materials from suppliers is highly correlated with and subject to fluctuations in
international commodity prices, including crude oil and semiconductor silicon
wafers/non-ferrous metals, we have implemented comprehensive risk management
strategies to mitigate the impact of such volatility.

We have established stringent supplier selection, evaluation and management
procedures to ensure that all suppliers meet our quality and performance standards.
During the Track Record Period, our principal suppliers primarily consisted of raw
material and component suppliers. In each of the relevant years/periods during the Track
Record Period, the aggregate purchases from our five largest suppliers accounted for
approximately 22.5%, 23.4% and 24.7% of our total purchases, respectively, while
purchases from our largest supplier accounted for approximately 9.6%, 7.8% and 8.5% of
our total purchases, respectively. All of our five largest suppliers in each year/period
during the Track Record Period are Independent Third Parties. As of the Latest Practicable
Date, none of our Directors, their associates or any of our Shareholders (who owned or, to
the knowledge of Directors, had owned more than 5% of our issued share capital) had any
interest in any of our five largest suppliers in each year/period during the Track Record
Period.

**SALES AND MARKETING**

We consistently adhere to a customer-oriented direct sales model, which enables us
to more accurately forecast and meet customer demand and to provide each customer
with comprehensive and attentive service. During the Track Record Period, all of our
revenue was generated from direct sales, and our customers primarily include automotive
manufacturers.

We are committed to providing comprehensive and high-quality solutions to global
automotive manufacturers by closely tracking industry development trends, actively
pursuing technology innovation, and responding swiftly to customer needs. Through
long-term, in-depth engagement in the automotive lighting industry, we have achieved
comprehensive customer coverage, spanning Chinese domestic automotive brands,
renowned global automotive brands and both conventional vehicle brands and new
energy vehicle brands. With respect to Chinese domestic automotive brands, we maintain

Our results of operations and, financial condition have been, and are expected to
continue to be, affected by the following key factors: (i) the development of the industries
where we operate; (ii) ability to maintain and engage customers and seize market
opportunities; (iii) R&D capabilities and product upgrades; (iv) our ability to control costs
and improve operational efficiency; (v) our management of trade and bills receivables;
and (vi) inventory management. Our profit for the year/period increased throughout the
Track Record Period, primarily driven by our revenue growth. The increase in revenues
during the Track Record Period were primarily because of growths in sales volume and
average selling price in intelligent automotive lighting products, and in particular, our
front and rear lighting products during the Track Record Period. The aggregate
contribution of intelligent front lighting products and the intelligent rear lighting
products in our total automotive lighting products by revenue also significantly increased
from 0.3% in 2023 to 13.6% in 2024 and from 13.6% in the nine months ended September
30, 2024 to 16.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2025. These were primary
driven by (i) the sustained growth of NEV market which drove an explosive growth in
demand for intelligent lighting products; (ii) our continuous efforts in technology and
product innovation and upgrading, and in particular, our strengthened and in-depth
cooperation with both existing and new customers in the PRC and worldwide through
participation in the early development stages (such as design and R&D) of the automotive
lighting products for their vehicle models; and (iii) our enhanced ability to quickly
integrate our production capabilities to fit in more comprehensive production demands of
intelligent automotive lighting products. See “Financial Information — Key Factors
Affecting Our Results of Operations” and “Financial Information — Results of
Operations” for details.
