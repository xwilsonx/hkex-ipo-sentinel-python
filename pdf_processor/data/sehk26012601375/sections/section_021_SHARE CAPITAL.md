**OUR SHARES**

Upon the completion of the [REDACTED], the shares of our Company will consist
of A Shares and H Shares. Both A Shares and H Shares are ordinary shares in our share
capital and are considered as one class of Shares.

Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect has established a stock connect mechanism
between PRC and Hong Kong. Our A Shares can be subscribed for and traded by PRC
investors, qualified foreign institutional investors or qualified foreign strategic investors
and must be traded in RMB. As our A Shares are eligible securities under the Northbound
Trading Link, they can also be [REDACTED] for and [REDACTED] by Hong Kong and
other overseas [REDACTED] pursuant to the rules and limits of Shanghai-Hong Kong
Stock Connect. Our H Shares can be [REDACTED] for or [REDACTED] by Hong Kong
and other overseas [REDACTED] and qualified domestic [REDACTED]. If our H Shares
are eligible securities under the Southbound Trading Link, they can also be [REDACTED]
for or [REDACTED] by mainland Chinese [REDACTED] in accordance with the rules and
limits of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect or Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect.

A Shares and H Shares will rank pari passu with each other in all respects and, in
particular, will rank equally for all dividends or distributions declared, paid or made after
the date of this Document. All dividends in respect of our H Shares are to be paid by us in
Hong Kong dollars whereas all dividends in respect of our A Shares are to be paid by us in
RMB. In addition to cash, dividends may also be distributed in the form of Shares. Holders
of our H Shares will receive share dividends in the form of H Shares, and holders of our A
Shares will receive share dividends in the form of A Shares.

**NO CONVERSION OF OUR A SHARES INTO H SHARES FOR [REDACTED] AND**

[REDACTED] ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE

A Shares and H Shares are generally neither interchangeable nor fungible, and the
market prices of our A Shares and H Shares may be different after the [REDACTED]. The

Companies (《H股公司境內未上市股份申請“全流通”業務指引》) announced by the CSRC are
not applicable to companies dual [REDACTED] in the PRC and on the Stock Exchange. As
of the Latest Practicable Date, there were no relevant rules or guidelines from the CSRC
providing that A Shareholders may convert A Shares held by them into H Shares for
