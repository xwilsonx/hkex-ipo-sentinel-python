**THE SERBIAN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES**

This section summarizes certain laws and regulations of Serbia that are of specific
relevance for our subsidiary in Serbia as a foreign investor, particularly in the areas of
corporate structure, foreign investment, product safety, product liability, data privacy,
customs, trade, environmental protection and taxations. It is intended to provide a general
overview and not to provide a complete or exhaustive description of all relevant Serbian
regulations applicable to a provider of automotive lighting products. The laws of the
Republic of Serbia are enacted by the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia.

**Law Regarding Corporate Structure**

The establishment, organization and operation of companies in Serbia are governed
by the Law on Companies (ZAKON O PRIVREDNIM DRUŠTVIMA, “Sl. glasnik RS”, br.
_36/2011, 99/2011, 83/2014 - dr. zakon, 5/2015, 44/2018, 95/2018, 91/2019, 109/2021 i 19/2025)_
(“Serbia Law on Companies”). This law sets out the general legal framework applicable
to corporate entities, including rules on incorporation, corporate governance, capital
structure and management.

Xingyu Serbia is established as a LLC (Limited Liability Company, in Serbian: d.o.o.,
abbr. for društvo sa ogranic´enom odgovornošc´u) in accordance with the Serbia Law on
Companies. A LLC under Serbian law may be incorporated by one or more members, and
the liability of its members for the company’s obligations is generally limited to the
amount of their respective capital contributions. A LLC has separate legal personality and
is liable for its obligations with its entire assets. Its members do not bear personal liability
for the company’s obligations beyond their capital contributions, except in circumstances
expressly prescribed by law. The capital of a limited liability company is divided into
ownership interests rather than shares, and the company is managed by one or more
directors.

**Law Regarding Foreign Investments and Exchange**

Foreign investors are in principle permitted to invest in Serbia on terms comparable
to those applicable to domestic investors, including by establishing new companies,
acquiring existing businesses or participating in joint ventures. There are generally no
restrictions on foreign ownership in the manufacture of automotive lighting products.

The principal legislation governing foreign investment is the Law on Investments
(ZAKON O ULAGANJIMA, “Sl. glasnik RS”, br. 89/2015 i 95/2018) (“Law on
**Investments”). This law provides a framework for investment activities in Serbia and sets**
out certain fundamental principles, including equal treatment of domestic and foreign
investors, freedom of investment, protection against expropriation, and the right to
transfer profits and capital subject to applicable regulations. Under this law, a foreign
investor may establish or acquire a company in Serbia under the same conditions as a
domestic investor, provided that the statutory requirements are satisfied. Company
incorporation and registration of business activities are carried out with the Serbian
Business Registers Agency (SBRA).


-----

Foreign exchange transactions in Serbia are governed by the Law on Foreign
Exchange Operations (Zakon o deviznom poslovanju, “Sl. glasnik RS”, br. 62/2006, 31/2011,
_119/2012, 139/2014, 30/2018 and 19/2025) (“Law on Foreign Exchange Operations”). This_
law establishes the legal framework for foreign currency transactions, cross-border
payments, foreign currency accounts, and settlements related to imports and exports.
Under Serbian law, companies are required to report foreign currency inflows and
outflows exceeding the prescribed thresholds to the National Bank of Serbia (“NBS”). In
addition, the law provides that certain foreign investments or loan arrangements may be
subject to specific licensing or approval requirements in accordance with the applicable
regulations.

**Law Regarding the Industrial Sector and Product Safety**

Product technical requirements and conformity assessment in Serbia are governed
by the Law on Technical Requirements for Products and Conformity Assessment (ZAKON
O TEHNIC[˘ ]KIM ZAHTEVIMA ZA PROIZVODE I OCENJIVANJU USAGLAŠENOSTI, “Sl.
_glasnik RS”, br. 49/2021) (“Law on Technical Requirements for Products and Conformity_
**Assessment”). This law imposes obligations on manufacturers to ensure that products,**
including automotive lighting products, comply with the applicable technical
requirements before being placed on the market. In practice, SRPS EN standards, which
are harmonized with relevant European standards, are applied in assessing conformity
with the prescribed technical requirements.

General product safety matters are governed by the Law on General Product Safety
(ZAKON O OPŠTOJ BEZBEDNOSTI PROIZVODA, “Sl. glasnik RS”, br. 41/2009 i 77/2019)
(“Law on General Product Safety”). Under Serbian law, products containing potential
hazardous substances are regulated. These regulations closely follow the relevant
European Union directives in this area. Accordingly, manufacturers are required to ensure
that both their components and finished products comply with the restrictions on
hazardous substances and product safety requirements.

Supervision over the implementation of product safety regulations is carried out by
the competent market inspection authorities. Such authorities are empowered to inspect
products placed on the market, technical documentation, markings, declarations of
conformity and compliance with applicable safety requirements. In cases of
non-compliance, regulatory measures may include bans on sale, withdrawal of products
from the market and the imposition of significant monetary fines on manufacturers and
responsible persons.

**Law Regarding Product Liability**

The Law on General Product Safety also governs product liability in Serbia. Under
this law, only safe products may be placed on the market. Manufacturers and distributors
are required to assess product risks, provide appropriate warnings and instructions for
use, and take corrective measures where necessary, including the withdrawal or recall of
products from the market if they pose a risk to consumer health and safety.


-----

The law establishes the criteria for determining whether a product is considered
safe or unsafe, as well as the obligations imposed on manufacturers and distributors.
Products are required to comply with descriptions, quality standards, functionality and
intended use.

**Law Regarding Data Privacy**

The protection of personal data in Serbia is governed by the Law on the Protection of
Personal Data (ZAKON O ZAŠTITI PODATAKA O LIC[˘ ]NOSTI, “Sl. glasnik RS”, br. 87/2018)
(“Law on the Protection of Personal Data”). This law regulates the processing of personal
data relating to employees, clients, suppliers and other individuals, and sets out the rights
of data subjects as well as the obligations of data controllers and data processors.

For companies engaged in the manufacture of automotive lighting products, the law
is applicable in connection with (i) the processing of employee personal data, including
data relating to employment, payroll calculation, occupational health and safety
compliance and related obligations, and (ii) the processing of consumer personal data,
including data storage, access and protection. Under this law, companies are required to
establish transparent and clearly defined procedures for the storage, access and protection
of personal data, and to adopt a privacy policy that is accessible to employees.

**Law Regarding Customs and Foreign Trade Regulations**

Serbia has established a customs and foreign trade regime governing the import,
export and transit of goods. The principal legislation regulating customs matters is the
Customs Law (CARINSKI ZAKON, “Sl. glasnik RS”, br. 95/2018, 91/2019 - dr. zakon,
_144/2020, 118/2021 i 138/2022) (“Serbian Customs Law”). This law governs, among other_
things, customs procedures, customs valuation, classification of goods, origin of goods,
customs duties and available customs reliefs. All goods are classified under the customs
tariff system, and the applicable treatment depends on the tariff classification, valuation
and origin of the goods.

Foreign trade activities are further regulated by the Law on Foreign Trade
Operations (ZAKON O SPOLJNOTRGOVINSKOM POSLOVANJU, “Sl. glasnik RS”, br.
_36/2009, 36/2011 - dr. zakon, 88/2011 i 89/2015 - dr. zakon) (“Law on Foreign Trade_
**Operations”). This law upholds the principle of free import and export while allowing**
restrictions where necessary to protect public security, human health, the environment or
to ensure compliance with Serbia’s international obligations. Depending on the nature of
products, certain goods may be subject to technical requirements, particularly where
electrical or electronic components or hazardous substances are involved.

Rules on the origin of goods are relevant to the application of preferential customs
treatment. Where the relevant conditions are satisfied and appropriate proof of origin is
provided, preferential customs rates may be applied under free trade agreements
concluded by Serbia with, among others, the EU, CEFTA (Central European Free Trade
Agreement), EFTA (European Free Trade Association) and certain other countries, which
may reduce customs costs for eligible lighting products.


-----

**Law Regarding Environmental Regulations**

Environmental matters in Serbia are governed by a set of environmental protection
laws applicable to manufacturing activities.

The Law on Environmental Protection (ZAKON O ZAŠTITI ŽIVOTNE SREDINE,
“Sl. glasnik RS”, br. 135/2004, 36/2009, 36/2009 - dr. zakon, 72/2009 - dr. zakon, 43/2011 _odluka US, 14/2016, 76/2018, 95/2018 - dr. zakon, 95/2018 - dr. zakon i 94/2024 - dr. zakon)_
(“Law on Environmental Protection”) establishes the fundamental principles of
environmental governance, including sustainable development, the “polluter pays”
principle, preventive action and the environmental responsibility of legal entities.
Manufacturing companies are required to organize their operations in a manner that
prevents or minimizes adverse environmental impacts and to implement appropriate
technical, organizational and monitoring measures.

The Law on Environmental Impact Assessment (ZAKON O PROCENI UTICAJA NA
ŽIVOTNU SREDINU, “Sl. glasnik RS”, br. 94/2024) (“Law on Environmental Impact
**Assessment”) also provides that, depending on the scale, location and nature of a project,**
certain production facilities may be subject to a mandatory environmental impact
assessment or a screening procedure to determine whether such assessment is required.
The assessment evaluates the potential impacts on air, water, soil, noise levels and human
health. Approval must be obtained prior to the construction or expansion of production
facilities.

The Law on Air Protection (ZAKON O ZAŠTITI VAZDUHA, “Sl. glasnik RS”, br.
_51/2025) applies to industrial processes that may generate emissions, including metal_
processing, coating, painting and the use of chemical substances commonly associated
with automotive lighting products manufacturing. Companies are required to comply
with applicable emission limit values, apply prescribed techniques and obtain relevant
permits for emission sources, with monitoring and reporting obligations depending on
the equipment and processes used.

Waste-related matters are governed by the Law on Waste Management (ZAKON O
UPRAVLJANJU OTPADOM, “Sl. _glasnik_ _RS”,_ _br._ _109/2025)_ (“Law **on** **Waste**
**Management”). This law is relevant to manufacturers of automotive lighting products**
due to the generation of industrial waste, packaging waste, electronic waste and
potentially hazardous waste. Under this law, producers are required to properly classify
waste, ensure safe storage, maintain records and transfer waste to authorized operators.


-----

Serbia’s environmental legislation continues to evolve in the context of its European
Union accession process. Regulatory standards in relation to waste electrical and
electronic equipment, hazardous substances, energy efficiency and emissions, are
expected to become progressively more stringent.

**Law Regarding Tax Regulations**

Serbia has established a tax framework applicable to corporate entities. For
companies conducting manufacturing and trading activities in Serbia, tax considerations
primarily relate to corporate income tax and value added tax. In addition, Serbia has
concluded a broad network of double taxation avoidance treaties that may be relevant to
cross-border payments.

**Corporate Income Tax**

Corporate income tax in Serbia is governed by the Law on Corporate Income Tax
(ZAKON O POREZU NA DOBIT PRAVNIH LICA, “Sl. glasnik RS”, br. 25/2001, 80/2002,
_80/2002 - dr. zakon, 43/2003, 84/2004, 18/2010, 101/2011, 119/2012, 47/2013, 108/2013, 68/2014_

_- dr. zakon, 142/2014, 91/2015 - autentic˘no tumac˘enje, 112/2015, 113/2017, 95/2018, 86/2019,_
_153/2020, 118/2021 i 94/2024) (“Corporate Income Tax Law”). Corporate income tax is_
levied on the taxable profit of legal entities. The tax base is determined by adjusting
accounting profit and the corporate income tax rate is a flat rate of 15%. Resident
companies are subject to corporate income tax on their worldwide income, while
non-resident companies are subject to tax only on income attributable to a permanent
establishment in Serbia.

The Corporate Income Tax Law also regulates transfer pricing and withholding tax
matters. Payments made to associated non-resident entities, such as dividends, interest
and royalties, are generally subject to withholding tax at a statutory rate of 20%, unless a
lower rate or exemption applies under an applicable double taxation avoidance treaty.
Serbia has entered into an extensive network of double taxation avoidance treaties, which
may reduce withholding taxes on certain categories of cross-border income, including
dividends, interest and royalties.

Serbia provides a range of tax incentives that may significantly reduce the effective
corporate income tax burden, depending on the nature, size and location of the
investment. These include accelerated tax benefits for R&D. In particular,
foreign-invested enterprises that invests more than Serbian Dinar (“RSD”) 1.0 billion in
its fixed assets, and employs at least 100 employees on an indefinite-term basis during the
investment period shall be exempt from corporate income tax for a period of ten years
from its first profit-making year. Xingyu Serbia will be exempt from corporate income tax
for a period of ten years commencing from its first profitable year.


-----

**Value Added Tax**

Value added tax (VAT) is regulated by the Value Added Tax Law (ZAKON O
POREZU NA DODATU VREDNOST, “Sl. glasnik RS”, br. 84/2004, 86/2004 - ispr., 61/2005,
_61/2007, 93/2012, 108/2013, 6/2014 - usklaðeni din. izn., 68/2014 - dr. zakon, 142/2014, 5/2015 -_
_usklaðeni din. izn., 83/2015, 5/2016 - usklaðeni din. izn., 108/2016, 7/2017 - usklaðeni din. izn.,_
_113/2017, 13/2018 - usklaðeni din. izn., 30/2018, 4/2019 - usklaðeni din. izn., 72/2019, 8/2020 -_
_usklaðeni din. izn., 153/2020, 138/2022, 94/2024 i 109/2025) (“Value Added Tax Law”). VAT_
is imposed on the supply of goods and services and on the importation of goods carried
out in the course of business. Foreign entities performing taxable supplies in Serbia are
generally required to register for VAT and appoint a fiscal representative, regardless of
turnover, unless specific statutory exemptions apply. Where a foreign supplier does not
appoint a fiscal representative, VAT may be accounted for by the Serbian recipient of the
goods or services.

The standard VAT rate in Serbia is 20%. A 0% VAT rate, with the right to deduct
input VAT, applies to exports of goods, international transport and services directly
related to exports. Certain transactions are exempt from VAT without the right to deduct
input VAT, including, among others, transactions in shares and securities, insurance and
reinsurance services, and the leasing of residential and business property.
