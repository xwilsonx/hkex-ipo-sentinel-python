**FUTURE PLANS**

See “Business — Our Strategies” in this document for a detailed discussion of our
future plans.

[REDACTED]

The net [REDACTED] from the [REDACTED] that we will receive, after deducting
the [REDACTED] and other estimated expenses paid and payable by us in connection
with the [REDACTED] is estimated to be approximately HK$[REDACTED] million,
assuming an [REDACTED] of HK$[REDACTED] per [REDACTED], being the mid-point
of the [REDACTED]. We currently intend to apply these net [REDACTED] for the
following intended purposes in the amounts set forth below:

-  Approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, representing [REDACTED]% of
the net [REDACTED], is expected to be used to enhance our global
manufacturing footprint, among which:

(i) approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, representing

[REDACTED]% of the net [REDACTED], is expected to be used for our
intelligent automotive electronics and vision systems industrial center
project in Changzhou. The overall master plan of the center comprises
four manufacturing facilities, two warehouses and one office building,
providing integrated support for production operations, materials
storage and comprehensive administrative functions. This project is
intended to support the expansion of our next-generation product
portfolio, which we believe will serve as a driver of future revenue
growth. It is expected to address potential capacity constraints arising
from growing demand, improve operational efficiency, and provide a
better foundation to support our long-term, stable and sustainable
development.

(ii) approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, representing

[REDACTED]% of the net [REDACTED], is expected to be used for the
phase II construction at our Serbian Manufacturing Base. This
expansion is designed to support our international development
strategy by strengthening localized production capabilities in Europe.
By aligning capacity deployment more closely with the requirements of
core European customers and responding to increasing regional order
demand, the phase II construction of our Serbian Manufacturing Base is
expected to enhance supply responsiveness, improve delivery efficiency
and reinforce our competitiveness in the European automotive market.

(iii) approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, representing

[REDACTED]% of the net [REDACTED], is expected to be used for the
construction of our planned Chongqing Manufacturing Base. This
project supports our strategic focus on the NEV market in southwestern
China and is intended to establish a localized supply chain integrating
R&D, manufacturing and supporting services. By strengthening
proximity to key regional customers and enabling efficient coordination
across the value chain, the planned Chongqing Manufacturing Base is
expected to consolidate our competitive position in the local market.

Approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, representing [REDACTED]% of
the net [REDACTED], is expected to be used for the following R&D projects,
among which:

(i) approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, representing

[REDACTED]% of the net [REDACTED], is expected to be used for the
iterative R&D and application of intelligent automotive lighting and
related systems based on DLP, Micro-LED and integrated perceptional
fusion technologies. This plan is intended to support the long-term
evolution of our intelligent automotive lighting products, and to
accelerate the commercialization of next-generation lighting solutions.

(ii) approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, representing

[REDACTED]% of the net proceeds, is expected to be used for the R&D
of weather-resistant and environmentally friendly materials tailored for
intelligent automotive lighting. This investment is intended to boost
proprietary materials capabilities, enhance product reliability across
diverse operating environments, and support long-term sustainable
innovation. We also plan to recruit to form a strong team in material
studies.

(iii) approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, representing

[REDACTED]% of the net proceeds, is expected to be used for the
construction and enhancement of intelligent automotive lighting
software solutions and development platforms. This initiative will
support the transition toward software-enabled lighting systems by
strengthening development efficiency and system intelligence. We
expect this platform to provide support for the long-term upgrade of
our intelligent lighting product portfolio.


-----

Approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, representing [REDACTED]% of
the net [REDACTED], is expected to be used to enhance our digital
infrastructure, among which:

(i) approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, representing

[REDACTED]% of the net proceeds, is expected to be used to optimize
and upgrade our core digital platforms across the entire value chain.
This initiative is intended to enhance global operational efficiency,
improve cross-regional coordination and support long-term growth by
strengthening integrated enterprise systems and digital infrastructure
underpinning production, supply chain management and customer
services.

(ii) approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, representing

[REDACTED]% of the net [REDACTED], is expected to be used for the
construction of a global automotive lighting R&D data center and
digital twin platform, the construction of supercomputing and
intelligent computing centers and to enhance our cloud-native digital
platforms and core IT capabilities.

Approximately HK$[REDACTED] million, representing [REDACTED]% of
the net [REDACTED], is expected to be used to further enhance our R&D in
embodied intelligence. The [REDACTED] allocated to embodied intelligence
will be deployed to establish a future-oriented innovation mechanism
supporting our long-term technology roadmap. We intend to build a
specialized R&D team combining a small number of industry-leading experts
with an experienced engineering backbone to advance our R&D in embodied
intelligence. In parallel, we plan to acquire pilot and trial production lines and
equipment to accelerate product validation and industrialization of embodied
intelligence solutions. We will also strengthen collaboration with leading
universities and research institutions to enhance foundational R&D
capabilities and facilitate the translation of frontier technologies into
commercial applications.

The remaining balance of approximately HK$[REDACTED] million,
representing [REDACTED]% of the net [REDACTED], is expected to be used
as working capital and general corporate purposes.


-----

It is expected that the [REDACTED] allocated to each of the above purposes will be
utilized within four years after the [REDACTED].

To the extent that the net [REDACTED] from the [REDACTED] are insufficient to
fund our Group’s business strategies, our Directors may delay the pace of the
implementation of such business strategies until we have sufficient internal resources.
Our Directors may also consider other factors when determining the pace of
implementation, such as the long-term funding needs and the need to maintain a healthy
level of working capital for our Group.

If the [REDACTED] is fixed at the high-end of the indicative range of the

[REDACTED], being HK$[REDACTED] per [REDACTED], the net [REDACTED] to be
received by our Group from the [REDACTED] will increase by approximately
HK$[REDACTED] million. Our Group intends to apply the additional net [REDACTED]
for the above purposes on a pro-rata basis. If the [REDACTED] is set at the low-end of the
indicative range of the [REDACTED], being HK$[REDACTED] per [REDACTED], the
net [REDACTED] to be received by our Group from the [REDACTED] will decrease by
approximately HK$[REDACTED] million. Our Group intends to reduce the net

[REDACTED] for the above purposes on a pro-rata basis.

To the extent that the net [REDACTED] from the [REDACTED] are not immediately
applied to the above purposes or if our Group is unable to effect any part of the future
plans as intended, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, our Group
will deposit the net [REDACTED] into short-term interest-bearing accounts at licensed
commercial banks and/or other authorized financial institutions (as defined under the
Securities and Futures Ordinance or applicable laws and regulations in other
jurisdictions). In such event or if there is any material change to the above proposed

[REDACTED], we will comply with the appropriate disclosure requirements under the
Listing Rules.
