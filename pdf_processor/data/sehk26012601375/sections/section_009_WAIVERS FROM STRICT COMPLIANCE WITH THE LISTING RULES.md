**WAIVER IN APPOINTMENT TO JOINT COMPANY SECRETARIES**

Pursuant to Rules 3.28 and Rule 8.17 of the Listing Rules, the company secretary
must be an individual who, by virtue of his/her academic or professional qualifications or
relevant experience, is, in the opinion of the Stock Exchange, capable of discharging the
functions of the company secretary. Note 1 to Rule 3.28 of the Listing Rules provides that
the Stock Exchange considers the following academic or professional qualifications to be
acceptable:

(i) a member of The Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute;

(ii) a solicitor or barrister (as defined in the Legal Practitioners Ordinance); and

(iii) a certified public accountant (as defined in the Professional Accountants
Ordinance).

For Note 2 to Rule 3.28 of the Listing Rules, the Stock Exchange will consider the
individual’s relevant experience for the following aspects:

(i) length of employment with the issuer and other issuers and the roles he/she
played;

(ii) familiarity with the Listing Rules and other relevant laws and regulations
including the Securities and Futures Ordinance, the Companies Ordinance,
the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance and
the Takeovers Code;

(iii) relevant training taken and/or to be taken in addition to the minimum
requirement under Rule 3.29 of the Listing Rules; and

(iv) professional qualifications in other jurisdictions.

Pursuant to Chapter 3.10 Listing Guide, the Stock Exchange will consider a waiver
application by an issuer in relation to Rules 3.28 and Rule 8.17 of the Listing Rules based
on the specific facts and circumstances. Factors that will be considered by the Stock
Exchange include:

(i) whether the issuer has principal business activities primarily outside Hong
Kong;

(ii) whether the issuer was able to demonstrate the need to appoint a person who
does not have the Acceptable Qualification nor Relevant Experience as a
company secretary; and

(iii) why the directors consider the individual to be suitable to act as the issuer’s
company secretary.


-----

Further, pursuant to Chapter 3.10 of the Listing Guide, such waiver, if granted, will
be for a fixed three years of time (the “Waiver Period”) and on the following conditions:

(i) the proposed company secretary must be assisted by a person who possesses
the qualifications or experience as required under Rule 3.28 of the Listing
Rules and is appointed as a joint company secretary throughout the Waiver
Period; and

(ii) the waiver will be revoked if there are material breaches of the Listing Rules
by the issuer.

Our Company considers that while it is important for the company secretary to be
familiar with the relevant securities regulation in Hong Kong, they also need to have
experience relevant to our Company’s operations, nexus to the Board and close working
relationship with the management of our Company in order to perform the function of a
company secretary and to take the necessary actions in the most effective and efficient
manner. It is for the benefit of our Company to appoint a person who is familiar with our
Company’s business and affairs as company secretary.

We have appointed Mr. Gao Peng (“Mr. Gao”) as our joint company secretary. As he
has extensive experience in accounting and finance but presently does not possess any of
the qualification required under Rules 3.28 and 8.17 of the Listing Rules, we have
appointed Mr. Au to assist with Mr. Gao. Mr. Au is a fellow member of both the Hong
Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales. Therefore, he meets the qualification requirements under Note 1 to
Rule 3.28 of the Listing Rules and complies with Rule 8.17 of the Listing Rules. Mr. Gao
and Mr. Au will be jointly discharging the duties and responsibilities of a company
secretary. Mr. Au will be assisting Mr. Gao in gaining the relevant experience required
under Rules 3.28 and 8.17 of the Listing Rules.

Accordingly, we have applied for, and the Stock Exchange [has granted], a waiver
from strict compliance with the requirements under Rules 3.28 and Rule 8.17 of the Listing
Rules in relation to the appointment of Mr. Au as our joint company secretary. Pursuant to
the Chapter 3.10 of the Listing Guide, such waiver [has been granted on the conditions
that:

(i) Mr. Au is appointed as a joint company secretary to assist Mr. Gao in
discharging his functions as a company secretary and in gaining the relevant
experience under Rule 3.28 of the Listing Rules;
