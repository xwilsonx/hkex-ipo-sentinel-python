**ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT ON HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE**
**DIRECTORS OF CHANGZHOU XINGYU AUTOMOTIVE LIGHTING SYSTEMS CO.,**
**LTD. AND HUATAI FINANCIAL HOLDINGS (HONG KONG) LIMITED**

**Introduction**

We report on the historical financial information of Changzhou Xingyu Automotive
Lighting Systems Co., Ltd. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the
“Group”) set out on pages I-[4] to I-[90], which comprises the consolidated statements of
financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2023 and 2024, the statements of
financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2023 and 2024 and the consolidated
statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statements
of changes in equity and the consolidated statements of cash flows of the Group for each
of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024 (the “Track Record Period”) and material
accounting policy information and other explanatory information (together, the
“Historical Financial Information”). The Historical Financial Information set out on
pages I-[4] to I-[90] forms an integral part of this report, which has been prepared for
inclusion in the Document of the Company dated [date] (the “Document”) in connection
with the [REDACTED] of the Company on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong Limited (the “Stock Exchange”).

**Directors’ responsibility for the Historical Financial Information**

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Historical
Financial Information that gives a true and fair view in accordance with the basis of
preparation set out in Note 3 to the Historical Financial Information, and for such internal
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the Historical
Financial Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

**Reporting accountants’ responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Historical Financial Information
and to report our opinion to you. We conducted our work in accordance with Hong Kong
Standard on Investment Circular Reporting Engagements 200, “Accountants’ Reports on
Historical Financial Information in Investment Circulars” issued by the Hong Kong
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the “HKICPA”). This standard requires that we
comply with ethical standards and plan and perform our work to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the Historical Financial Information is free from material
misstatement.


-----

Our work involved performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the Historical Financial Information. The procedures selected depend
on the reporting accountants’ judgement, including the assessment of risks of material
misstatement of the Historical Financial Information, whether due to fraud or error. In
making those risk assessments, the reporting accountants consider internal control
relevant to the entity’s preparation of the Historical Financial Information that gives a
true and fair view in accordance with the basis of preparation set out in Note 3 to the
Historical Financial Information in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control. Our work also included evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the
directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Historical Financial
Information.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

**Opinion**

In our opinion the Historical Financial Information gives, for the purposes of the
accountants’ report, a true and fair view of the Group’s and the Company’s financial
position as at December 31, 2023 and 2024 and of the Group’s financial performance and
cash flows for the Track Record Period in accordance with the basis of preparation set out
in Note 3 to the Historical Financial Information.

**Review of stub period financial information**

We have reviewed the stub period financial information of the Group which
comprises the consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income,
the consolidated statements of changes in equity and the consolidated statements of cash
flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025, the consolidated statement
of financial position of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company
as at September 30, 2025 and other explanatory information (the “Stub Period Financial
**Information”). The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the**
Stub Period Financial Information in accordance with the basis of preparation set out in
Note 3 to the Historical Financial Information. Our responsibility is to express a
conclusion on the Stub Period Financial Information based on our review. We conducted
our review in accordance with Hong Kong Standard on Review Engagements 2410,
“Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity” issued by the HKICPA. A review consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other
review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us
to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be
identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Based on our
review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Stub Period
Financial Information, for the purposes of the accountants’ report, is not prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with the basis of preparation set out in Note 3 to the
Historical Financial Information.

**NOTES TO THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**1.** **GENERAL INFORMATION AND BASIS OF PREPARATION OF HISTORICAL**
**FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

常州星宇車燈股份有限公司 Changzhou Xingyu Automotive Lighting Systems Co.,
Ltd. (the “Company”) was established in the People’s Republic of China (the
“PRC”) on May 18, 2000 as a limited liability company. In October 2007, the
Company was converted into a joint stock company with limited liability under the
Company Laws. In February 2011, the Company was listed on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange (stock code: 601799.SH). The addresses of the registered office and the
principal place of business of the Company is No. 398 Hanjiang Road, Xinbei
District, Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, the PRC and No. 182 Qining Road,
Xinbei District, Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, the PRC respectively.

The Group is principally engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and
sales of automotive lighting products.

**2.** **APPLICATION OF IFRS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS**

The International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) has issued a number of
new and revised IFRS Accounting Standards. For the purpose of preparing this
Historical Financial Information, the Group adopted all applicable new and revised
IFRS Accounting Standards to the Track Record Period. The new and revised
accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective for the
accounting period beginning on January 1, 2025 are set out as below.

**_New and amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards in issue but not yet effective_**

At the date of this report, the Group has not early applied the following new and
amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards that have been issued but are not yet
effective:

IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements[2]

IFRS 19 and its amendments Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures[2]

Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of
Financial Instruments[1]

Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 Contracts Referencing Nature-dependent Electricity[1]

Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its
Associate or Joint Venture[3]

Annual Improvements to IFRS Amendments to IFRS 1, IFRS 7, IFRS 9, IFRS 10 and IAS 7[1]
Accounting Standards – Volume II

Amendments to IAS 21 Translation to a Hyperinflationary Presentation Currency[2]

1 Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2026

2 Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027

3 No mandatory effective date yet determined but available for adoption


-----

Except for the new IFRS Accounting Standard mentioned below, the directors of the
Company anticipate that the application of all other new and amendments to IFRS
Accounting Standards will have no material impact on the Group’s consolidated
financial statements in the foreseeable future.

**IFRS 18 “Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements”**

IFRS 18 sets out requirements on presentation and disclosures in financial
statements and it will replace IAS 1“Presentation of Financial Statements”. The new
standard introduces new requirements to present specified categories and defined
subtotals in the statement of profit or loss; provide disclosures on
management-defined performance measures in the notes to the financial statements
and improve aggregation and disaggregation of information to be disclosed in the
financial statements. Minor amendments to IAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows” and
IAS 33 “Earnings per Share” are also made. IFRS 18 will be effective for annual
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027, with early application permitted. The
application of the new standard is expected to affect the presentation of the
consolidated statement of profit or loss and disclosures in the future financial
statements. The Group will continue to assess the impact of IFRS 18 on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements.

**3.** **MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION**

**Basis of preparation of the Historical Financial Information**

The Historical Financial Information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS
Accounting Standards issued by the IASB. For the purpose of preparation of the
Historical Financial Information, information is considered material if such
information is reasonably expected to influence decisions made by primary users. In
addition, the Historical Financial Information includes applicable disclosures
required by the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange and
by the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

The statutory financial statements of the Company for each of the years ended
December 31, 2023 and 2024 were prepared in accordance with Accounting
Standards for Business Enterprises issued by the Ministry of Finance of the PRC and
were audited by Talent Certified Public Accountants* (天衡會計師事務所（特殊普通
合夥）), a certified public accountants registered in the PRC.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Historical Financial Information has been prepared on the historical cost basis
except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of
each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies set out below.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of consideration given in
exchange for goods and services.

-  _The official name of these entities in Chinese. The English is for identification purpose only._


-----

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using
another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the
Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market
participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or
liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure
purposes in the Historical Financial Information is determined on such a basis,
except for leasing transactions that are within the scope of IFRS “16 Leases”, and
measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as
net realisable value in IAS 2 “Inventories” or value in use in IAS 36 Impairment of
Assets.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market
participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest
and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in
its highest and best use.

For financial instruments which are transacted at fair value and a valuation
technique that unobservable inputs is to be used to measure fair value in subsequent
years/periods, the valuation technique is calibrated so that the results of the
valuation technique equals the transaction price.

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are
categorized into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair
value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair
value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:

-  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;

-  Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1,
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and

-  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The principal accounting policies are set out below.

**Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the
Company and entities controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries. Control is
achieved when the Company:

-  has power over the investee;

-  is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the
investee; and


-----

-  has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and
circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of
control listed above.

When the Group has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has
power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical
ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Group
considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the
Group’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:

-  the size of the Group’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and
dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders;

-  potential voting rights held by the Group, other vote holders or other parties;
rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and

-  any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Group has, or
does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time
that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous
shareholders’ meetings.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the
subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically,
income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are
included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive
income from the date the Group gains control until the date when the Group ceases
to control the subsidiary.

When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to
bring their accounting policies in line with the Group’s accounting policies.

All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows
relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on
consolidation.

**Business combinations**

A business is an integrated set of activities and assets which includes an input and a
substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create
outputs. The acquired processes are considered substantive if they are critical to the
ability to continue producing outputs, including an organized workforce with the
necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform the related processes or they
significantly contribute to the ability to continue producing outputs and are
considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or
delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.


-----

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The
consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which
is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred
by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former equity holders of the
acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the
acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognized in profit or loss as
incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
are recognized at their fair value, except that:

-  deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to employee
benefit arrangements are recognized and measured in accordance with IAS 12
“Income Taxes” and IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” respectively;

-  liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements
of the acquiree or share-based payment arrangements of the Group entered
into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are
measured in accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment” at the acquisition
date (see the accounting policy below);

-  assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance
with IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”
are measured in accordance with that standard; and

-  lease liabilities are recognized and measured at the present value of the
remaining lease payments (as defined in IFRS 16) as if the acquired leases
were new leases at the acquisition date, except for leases for which (a) the
lease term ends within 12 months of the acquisition date; or (b) the underlying
asset is of low value. Right-of-use assets are recognized and measured at the
same amount as the relevant lease liabilities, adjusted to reflect favourable or
unfavourable terms of the lease when compared with market terms.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the
amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the
acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net
amount of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as at
acquisition date. If, after re-assessment, the net amount of the identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred,
the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the
acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized
immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.

Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their
holders to a proportionate share of the relevant subsidiary’s net assets in the event
of liquidation are initially measured at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate
share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets or at fair
value.


-----

When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination
includes a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is
measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration
transferred in a business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent
consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted
retrospectively. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from
additional information obtained during the “measurement period” (which cannot
exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that
existed at the acquisition date.

The subsequent accounting for the contingent consideration that do not qualify as
measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is
classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at
subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within
equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is
remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates, with the corresponding gain
or loss being recognized in profit or loss.

When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held
equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e.
the date when the Group obtains control), and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is
recognized in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, as appropriate.
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that
have previously been recognized in other comprehensive income and measured
under IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” would be accounted for on the same basis as
would be required if the Group had disposed directly of the previously held equity
interest.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the
reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional
amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional
amounts are adjusted retrospectively during the measurement period, and
additional assets or liabilities are recognized, to reflect new information obtained
about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known,
would have affected the amounts recognized at that date.

**Interests in subsidiaries**

Interests in subsidiaries are included in the statements of financial position of the
Company at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

**Revenue from contracts with customers**

The Group recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied,
i.e. when “control” of the goods or services underlying the particular performance
obligation is transferred to the customers.

A performance obligation represents a good or service (or a bundle of goods or
services) that is distinct or a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially
the same.


-----

Control is transferred over time and revenue is recognized over time by reference to
the progress towards complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation if
one of the following criteria is met:

-  the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by
the Group’s performance as the Group performs;

-  the Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer
controls as the Group performs; or

-  the Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to
the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance
completed to date.

Otherwise, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains
control of the distinct good or service.

A contract asset represents the Group’s right to consideration in exchange for goods
or services that the Group has transferred to a customer that is not yet
unconditional. It is assessed for impairment in accordance with IFRS 9. In contrast,
a receivable represents the Group’s unconditional right to consideration, i.e. only
the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due. A
contract liability represents the Group’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a
customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of
consideration is due) from the customer.

Information about the Group’s accounting policies relating to revenue from
contracts with customers is provided in Note 5 to the Historical Financial
Information.

**Leases**

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the definition
under IFRS 16 at inception of the contract. Such contract will not be reassessed
unless the terms and conditions of the contract are subsequently changed.

**_The Group as a lessee_**

_Allocation of consideration to components of a contract_

For a contract that contains a lease component and one or more additional lease or
non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each
lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease
component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components,
including contract for acquisition of ownership interests of a property which
includes both leasehold land and non-lease building components, unless such
allocation cannot be made reliably.

Non-lease components are separated from lease component and are accounted for
by applying other applicable standards.


-----

_Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to leases that have a
lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a
purchase option. It also applies the recognition exemption for lease of low-value
assets (such as tablets and personal computers, small items of office furniture and
telephones). Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are
recognized as expense on a straight-line basis or another systematic basis over the
lease term.

_Right-of-use assets_

The cost of right-of-use asset includes:

-  the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;

-  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease
incentives received;

-  any initial direct costs incurred by the Group; and

-  an estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group in dismantling and removing
the underlying assets, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the
underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the
lease.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.

Right-of-use assets in which the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of
the underlying leased assets at the end of the lease term are depreciated from
commencement date to the end of the useful life. Otherwise, right-of-use assets are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and
the lease term.

The Group presents right-of-use assets as a separate line item on the consolidated
statement of financial position.

_Lease liabilities_

At the commencement date of a lease, the Group recognizes and measures the lease
liability at the present value of lease payments that are unpaid at that date. In
calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental
borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the
lease is not readily determinable.


-----

The lease payments include:

-  fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease
incentives receivable;

-  variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured
using the index or rate as at the commencement date;

-  amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value
guarantees;

-  the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to
exercise the option; and

-  payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the
Group exercising an option to terminate the lease.

After the commencement date, lease liabilities are adjusted by interest accretion and
lease payments.

The Group remeasures lease liabilities (and makes a corresponding adjustment to
the related right-of-use assets) whenever:

-  the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of
a purchase option, in which case the related lease liability is remeasured by
discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the
date of reassessment.

-  the lease payments change due to changes in market rental rates following a
market rent review in which cases the related lease liability is remeasured by
discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate.

-  a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as
a separate lease. The Group presents lease liabilities as a separate line item on
the consolidated statement of financial position.

**Foreign currencies**

In preparing the financial statements of each individual group entity, transactions in
currencies other than the functional currency of that entity (foreign currencies) are
recognized at the rates of exchanges prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At
the end of the reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies
are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at
fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates
prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. When a fair value gain
or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in profit or loss, any exchange
component of that gain or loss is also recognized in profit or loss. When a fair value


-----

**Employee benefits**

**_Retirement benefit costs_**

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognized as an
expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.

**_Short-term employee benefits_**

Short-term employee benefits are recognized at the undiscounted amount of the
benefits expected to be paid as and when employees rendered the services. All
short-term employee benefits are recognized as an expense unless another IFRS
requires or permits the inclusion of the benefit in the cost of an asset. A liability is
recognized for benefits accruing to employees (such as wages and salaries, annual
leave and sick leave) after deducting any amount already paid.

**Taxation**

Income tax expense represents the sum of current and deferred income tax expense.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit
differs from profit before tax because of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax
liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred
tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those
deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such deferred tax assets and
liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a
transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit and at the
time of the transaction does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary
differences. In addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if the temporary
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.


-----

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated
with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures,
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable
future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated
with such investments and interests are only recognized to the extent that it is
probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the
benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the
foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting
period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable
profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to
apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on
tax rate (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of
the reporting period.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences
that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the
reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Current and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are tangible assets that are held for use in the
production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes (other
than freehold lands and construction in progress as described below). Property,
plant and equipment are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at
cost less subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated
impairment losses, if any.

Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production, supply
or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognized impairment loss.
Costs include any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
management.

Depreciation is recognized so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual
values over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. The
estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the
end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted
for on a prospective basis.


-----

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no
future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant
and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided to write off the cost less
their estimated residual value over their estimated useful lives, using the
straight-line method, as follows:

Building. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20-40 years
Plant and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3-20 years
Office equipment. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3-5 years
Motor vehicle . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4-7 years
Others . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4-10 years

The assets’ estimated residual value, depreciation method and estimated useful
lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.

**Intangible assets**

**_Intangible assets acquired separately or in a business combination_**

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost. The cost of
intangible assets acquired in a business combination is its fair value at the
acquisition date. After initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less
accumulated amortization and any impairment losses.

**_Internally-developed intangible assets (Research and development expenditures)_**

Expenditures associated with research activities are expensed in profit or loss as
they occur. Expenditures that are directly attributable to development activities are
recognized as intangible assets provided they meet the following recognition
requirements:

-  demonstration of technical feasibility of the prospective product for internal
use or sale;

-  there is intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

-  the Group’s ability to use or sell the intangible asset is demonstrated;

-  the intangible asset will generate probable economic benefits through internal
use or sale;

-  sufficient technical, financial and other resources are available for completion;
and

-  the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset can be reliably measured.


-----

Direct costs include staff costs incurred on development activities along with an
appropriate portion of relevant overheads. The expenditure of development of
internally generated software, products or know-how that meet the above
recognition criteria are recognized as intangible assets and are recognized initially
at cost. After initial recognition, they are carried at cost less accumulated
amortization and impairment losses, if any. Development expenditures not
satisfying the above criteria are expensed when incurred.

**_Amortization of intangible assets_**

Amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is provided on straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of intangible
assets are as follows:

Patent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2-5 years
Non-patented technology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years

Amortization commence when the intangible assets are available for use. The asset’s
amortization method and estimated useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if
appropriate, at each reporting date.

Intangible assets are not amortized where their useful lives are assessed to be
indefinite. Any conclusion that the useful life of an intangible asset is indefinite is
reviewed annually to determine whether events and circumstances continue to
support the indefinite useful life assessment for that asset. If they do not, the change
in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is accounted for prospectively
from the date of change and in accordance with the policy for amortization of
intangible assets with finite lives as set out above.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents presented on the consolidated statement of financial
position include:

-  cash, which comprises of cash on hand and demand deposits, excluding bank
balances that are subject to regulatory restrictions that result in such balances
no longer meeting the definition of cash; and

-  cash equivalents, which comprises of short-term (generally with original
maturity of three months or less), highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible to a known amount of cash and which are subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash equivalents are held for the
purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment
or other purposes.

For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above.


-----

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs of
inventories are determined on a weighted average method. Net realisable value
represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of
completion and costs necessary to make the sale. Costs necessary to make the sale
include incremental costs directly attributable to the sale.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or
constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required
to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the
consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting
period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present
obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (where the
effect of the time value of money is material).

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when a group entity becomes
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All regular way purchases or
sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date basis.
Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require
delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in
the market place.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value except
for trade receivables arising from contracts with customers which are initially
measured in accordance with IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts With Customers”.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial
assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets or financial liabilities at
FVTPL) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or
financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly
attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are
recognized immediately in profit or loss. The effective interest method is a method
of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability and of
allocating interest income and interest expense over the relevant period.

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash
receipts and payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an
integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or
discounts) through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability, or,
where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial
recognition.


-----

**Financial assets**

**_Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets_**

Financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at
amortized cost:

-  the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect
contractual cash flows; and

-  the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at
FVTOCI:

-  the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved
by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets; and

-  the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

All other financial assets are subsequently measured at FVTPL, except that at initial
recognition of a financial asset the Group may irrevocably elect to present
subsequent changes in fair value of an equity instruments in other comprehensive
income if that equity instruments is neither held for trading nor contingent
consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3
“Business Combinations” applies.

A financial asset is held for trading if:

-  it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term; or

-  on initial recognition it is a part of a portfolio of identified financial
instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern
of short-term profit-taking; or

-  it is a derivative that is not a designated and effective hedging instrument.

In addition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that are required
to be measured at the amortized cost or FVTOCI as measured at FVTPL if doing so
eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.


-----

_Amortized cost and interest income_

Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method for debt
instruments measured subsequently at amortized cost and at FVTOCI. Interest
income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying
amount of a financial asset, except for financial assets that have subsequently
become credit-impaired. For financial assets that have subsequently become
credit-impaired, interest income is recognized by applying the effective interest rate
to the amortized cost of the financial asset from the next reporting period. If the
credit risk on the credit-impaired financial instrument improves so that the financial
asset is no longer credit-impaired, interest income is recognized by applying the
effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset from the
beginning of the reporting period following the determination that the asset is no
longer credit-impaired.

**_Impairment of financial assets subject to impairment assessment under IFRS 9_**

The Group performs impairment assessment under ECL model on financial assets
(including trade and bills receivables, deposits and other receivables and cash and
cash equivalents and restricted bank deposits) which are subject to impairment
assessment under IFRS 9. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to
reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition.

Lifetime ECL represents the ECL that will result from all possible default events
over the expected life of the relevant instrument. In contrast, 12-month ECL
represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events
that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. Assessments are done
based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are
specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the
current conditions at the reporting date as well as the forecast of future conditions.

The Group recognized both 12-month and lifetime ECL for trade and bills
receivables.

For all other instruments, the Group measures the loss allowance equal to 12-month
ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial
recognition, in which case the Group recognizes lifetime ECL. The assessment of
whether lifetime ECL should be recognized is based on significant increases in the
likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition.

_(i)_ _Significant increase in credit risk_

In assessing whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial
recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the
financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default
occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition. In
making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and
qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including
historical experience and forward-looking information that is available
without undue cost or effort.


-----

In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing
whether credit risk has increased significantly:

-  an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial
instrument’s external (if available) or internal credit rating;

-  significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk, e.g.
a significant increase in the credit spread, the credit default swap prices
for the debtor;

-  existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic
conditions that are expected to cause a significant decrease in the
debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations;

-  an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of
the debtor;

-  an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory,
economic, or technological environment of the debtor that results in a
significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations.

Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group presumes that
the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition when
contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, unless the Group has
reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates otherwise.

Despite the foregoing, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a debt
instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the debt
instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A debt
instrument is determined to have low credit risk if (i) it has a low risk of
default, (ii) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash
flow obligations in the near term and (iii) adverse changes in economic and
business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce
the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations. The
Group considers a debt instrument to have low credit risk when it has an
internal or external credit rating of “investment grade” as per globally
understood definitions.

The Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify
whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and revises them as
appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable of identifying significant
increase in credit risk before the amount becomes past due.


-----

_(ii)_ _Definition of default_

For internal credit risk management, the Group considers an event of default
occurs when information developed internally or obtained from external
sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the
Group, in full (without taking into account any collaterals held by the Group).

Irrespective of the above, the Group considers that default has occurred when
a financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has
reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging
default criterion is more appropriate.

_(iii)_ _Credit-impaired financial assets_

A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a
detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset
have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes
observable data about the following events:

-  significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;

-  a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;

-  the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons
relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty, having granted to the
borrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise
consider;

-  it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other
financial reorganization.

_(iv)_ _Write-off policy_

The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating
that the counterparty is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic
prospect of recovery, for example, when the counterparty has been placed
under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Financial
assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the
Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where
appropriate. A write-off constitutes a derecognition event. Any subsequent
recoveries are recognized in profit or loss.


-----

_(v)_ _Measurement and recognition of ECL_

The measurement of ECL is a function of the probability of default, loss given
default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a default) and the exposure at
default. The assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is
based on historical data and forward-looking information. Estimation of ECL
reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined
with the respective risks of default occurring as the weights. The Group uses a
practical expedient in estimating ECL on trade and bills receivables using a
provision matrix taking into consideration historical credit loss experience
and forward looking information that is available without undue cost or
effort.

Generally, the ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are
due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the
Group expects to receive, discounted at the effective interest rate determined
at initial recognition.

Lifetime ECL for trade and bills receivables are considered on a collective
basis taking into consideration past due information and relevant credit
information such as forward looking macroeconomic information.

For collective assessment, the Group takes into consideration the following
characteristics when formulating the grouping:

-  Past-due status;

-  Nature, size and industry of debtors; and

-  External credit ratings where available.

The grouping is regularly reviewed by management to ensure the constituents
of each group continue to share similar credit risk characteristics.

Interest income is calculated based on the gross carrying amount of the
financial asset unless the financial asset is credit-impaired, in which case
interest income is calculated based on amortized cost of the financial asset.

The Group recognizes an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all
financial instruments by adjusting their carrying amount, with the exception
of trade and bills receivables and other receivables where the corresponding
adjustment is recognized through a loss allowance account.


-----

**_Derecognition/modification of financial assets_**

The Group derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the
cash flows from the asset expire.

On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortized cost, the difference
between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and
receivable is recognized in profit or loss.

A modification of a financial asset occurs if the contractual cash flows are
renegotiated or otherwise modified.

When the contractual terms of a financial asset are modified, the Group assesses
whether the revised terms result in a substantial modification from original terms
taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances including qualitative
factors. If qualitative assessment is not conclusive, the Group considers the terms
are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under
the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received, and discounted
using the original effective interest rate, is at least 10 per cent different from the
discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial asset.
For non-substantial modifications of financial assets that do not result in
derecognition, the carrying amount of the relevant financial assets will be calculated
at the present value of the modified contractual cash flows discounted at the
financial assets’ original effective interest rate. Transaction costs or fees incurred are
adjusted to the carrying amount of the modified financial assets and are amortized
over the remaining term. Any adjustment to the carrying amount of the financial
asset is recognized in profit or loss at the date of modification.

**Financial liabilities and equity**

**_Classification as debt or equity_**

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity
in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the
definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

_Equity instruments_

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets
of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the
Group are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

_Financial liabilities_

All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method.


-----

**_Derecognition of financial liabilities_**

The Group derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s
obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the
carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid
and payable is recognized in profit or loss.

**4.** **CRITICAL** **ACCOUNTING** **JUDGEMENTS** **AND** **KEY** **SOURCES** **OF**
**ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY**

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3
to the Historical Financial Information, the Directors are required to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and
underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that
are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the reporting period in which
the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that reporting period, or in the
reporting period of the revision and future reporting years/periods if the revision
affects both current and future reporting years/periods.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources
of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that may have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year.

**Allowance for ECL on trade and bills receivables**

Trade and bills receivables are assessed for ECL using a provision matrix. Trade and
bills receivables with significant balances and credit-impaired are assessed for ECL
individually.

The provision matrix of ECL is sensitive to changes in estimates. The information
about the ECL and the Group’s trade and bills receivables are disclosed in Note 20 to
the Historical Financial Information.


-----

The Group’s automotive lighting products sales can generally be divided into
direct sales and export sales. Under the direct sales model, the Group
recognizes sales revenue when the products are shipped and accepted; for
export sales, the Group recognizes sales revenue when the automotive
lighting products are shipped to the end customer and the export customs
declaration and bill of lading are obtained.

_Sales of other goods_

The Group sells other goods to customers. A contract liability is recognized for
advance payments received for sales in which revenue has yet been
recognized.

The Group recognizes sales revenue when the products are shipped and
accepted.

**_Sales returns_**

Based on the Group’s sales contracts with the customers, they can only return
or request for refund if the product delivered to them does not meet the
pre-specified quality requirement; otherwise, the Group does not accept
product returns or exchanges without the management’s consent.

**_Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation for_**
**_contracts with customers_**

Automotive lighting products are delivered within a period of less than one
year. As permitted under IFRS 15, the transaction price allocated to these
unsatisfied contracts is not disclosed.

**(ii)** **Segment information**

Information reported to the executive directors of the Company, being the
chief operating decision makers (“CODM”), for the purposes of resources
allocation and assessment of performance, focuses specifically on the revenue
analysis by principal categories of the Group’s business. The principal
categories of the Group’s business are manufacturing and trading of
automotive lighting products. No other discrete financial information is
regularly provided to the CODM for the purposes of resources allocation and
performance assessment other than the Group’s results and financial
performance as a whole. Accordingly, only entity-wide disclosures, including
major customers and geographical information are presented.

deposits and other receivables were measured based on the 12-month ECL if they
were not past due and there was no information indicating that the financial assets
had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. Otherwise, they
were measured based on the lifetime ECL. An impairment analysis was performed
at the end of each of the reporting period.

**33.** **SHARE AWARDS**

**Restricted share stock schemes**

The following is a summary of the principal terms of employee stock scheme
approved by shareholders on December 2, 2024 (the “Employee Stock Scheme”).
The terms of Employee Stock Schemes are substantially similar and are summarized
below.

_(i)_ _Purpose_

The purpose of the Employee Stock Scheme is to establish a community of
shared future and career community among the Group, shareholders and key
employees, which will enhance the interest sharing mechanism among the
same, mobilizing and boosting the cohesion, initiative, and creativity of the
teams. The Employee Stock Scheme will incentivize key employees to strive
toward building the Company into an outstanding industry leader in the long
term, continuously improving corporate governance, and promoting the
Company’s long-term, sustainable, and healthy development.

_(ii)_ _Administration_

The Employee Stock Scheme is executed by the board of directors of the
Company subject to the approval by the Shareholders’ meeting. The meeting
of all participants of the Employee Stock Scheme (the “Participants”) shall
have the full power to administer the Employee Stock Scheme. A management
committee, the members of which are elected by the meetings of the
Participants, is authorized to oversee the day-to-day management of the
Employee Stock Scheme.


-----

_(iii)_ _Participation_

The Participants will consist of senior and middle-level management,
technology experts and staff, and other core employees of the Group as the
board of the directors of the Company determines from time to time to receive
awards under the Employee Stock Scheme. The numbers of Participants under
Employee Stock Scheme shall be no more than 63.

_(iv)_ _Source and maximum number of shares_

The shares underlying the Employee Stock Scheme shall be ordinary share
issued by the Company, which are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (the
“A Shares”) repurchased by the Company from the open market and
transferred to the Employee Stock Scheme. Each award granted represents the
entitlement to the corresponding portion of A Shares underlying the
Employee Stock Scheme (the “Awards”). These Awards are subject to a
lock-up period and will only be unlocked upon fulfilling the unlocking
conditions stipulated. The maximum number of shares in respect of the
Awards that can be granted under each of the Employee Stock Scheme is as
follows:


**Maximum**
**number of**
**shares granted**
**under the**
**Employee Stock** **Number of**
**Scheme** **Participants**


**Employee Stock Scheme**


Employee Stock Scheme . . . . . . . . . 540,000 No more than 63

_(v)_ _Date of grant and term of schemes_

The term of each Employee Stock Scheme shall be 72 months commencing
from the date of the public announcement regarding the transfer of the last
tranche of relevant A Shares into the stock account under the relevant
Employee Stock Scheme (the “Commencement Date”). Should the Employee
Stock Scheme not be extended upon its expiration, it will automatically
terminate. On December 19, 2024, the Company made announcements that all
A shares relevant to the Employee Stock Scheme has been transferred to the
stock account for the Employee Stock Scheme.


-----

Each of the Employee Stock Scheme will be automatically terminated if not
extended upon the expiration of the 72 months. Either Employee Stock
Scheme can be early terminated or extended before the expiration of its valid
term subject to 2/3 approvals (inclusive) by the Participants attending the
Participants’ meeting and the approval by the board of directors of the
Company. The Employee Stock Scheme shall also be early cancelled if all of
the A shares under either Employee Stock Scheme have been unlocked, sold
and distributed.

_(vi)_ _Performance targets and lock-up_

Subject to the comprehensive performance evaluation by the remuneration
committee under the board of directors of the Company regarding the
fulfillment and the performance of each Participant, covering the evaluation
period from 2024 to 2026 under the Employee Stock Scheme, the Awards held
by the Participants shall be unlocked in three installments in the proportion of
40%, 30% and 30%, commencing from 12 months, 24 months and 36 months
respectively after the Commencement Date under the corresponding
Employee Stock Scheme. The unlocked Awards shall be distributed in
combination of the following manners:

(a) sold by the management committee as authorized by the meetings of the
Participants, with the proceeds to be distributed to the relevant
Participants proportionately;

(b) Arrange non-transaction transfer of the relevant portion of the A shares
underlying the unlocked granted Awards to the individual stock
account of a Participant; or

(c) a combination of the above (a) and (b).

Employee Stock Scheme as a result of events such as the distribution of share
dividends and capitalization of capital reserve by the Company shall also be
subject to the above lock-up arrangement.

_(vii)_ _Grant price_

**_Market risk_**

_Currency risk_

The Group is mainly exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from future
commercial transactions, and from recognized assets and liabilities. The functional
currency of the Company and its major subsidiaries in the PRC is RMB in which
most of the transactions are denominated. The functional currencies of subsidiary
operating in the Serbia is RSD in which most of their transactions are denominated.
The Group is mainly exposed to foreign exchange risk in respect of exchange
fluctuations of RMB against RSD. The Group does not have foreign currency
hedging policy in respect of foreign currency assets and liabilities during the
reporting period. The Group will monitor its foreign currency exposure closely and
will consider hedging significant foreign currency exposure should the need arise.

The Group did not have any significant financial assets or financial liabilities that
are denominated in a currency other than their functional currency during the
reporting period. Therefore, the management does not expect that there will be any
significant currency risk.

No sensitivity analysis on currency risk is presented as management consider the
sensitivity on currency risk is insignificant.

_Interest rate risk_

The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk in relation to lease liabilities.
The Group is also exposed to cash flow interest rate risk in relation to variable-rate
financial assets at FVTPL and bank balance. The Group manages its interest rate
exposures by assessing the potential impact arising from any interest rate
movements based on interest rate level and outlook.

No sensitivity analysis on interest rate risk on financial assets at FVTPL and bank
balance is presented as management consider the sensitivity on interest rate risk on
financial assets at FVTPL and bank balance is insignificant.

_Other price risk_

The Group is exposed to equity price risk through its investments in equity
securities measured at FVTOCI. For equity securities measured at FVTOCI quoted
in the Stock Exchange, the management of the Group manages this exposure by
maintaining a portfolio of investments with different risks. In addition, the Group
also invested in certain unquoted equity securities for investees operating in
relevant industry sector for long term strategic purposes which had been designated
as FVTOCI. The Group has appointed a special team to monitor the price risk and
will consider hedging the risk exposure should the need arise. The directors manage
this risk exposure by maintaining a portfolio of investments with different risk and
return profiles and will consider hedging the risk exposure should the need arise if
necessary.


-----

As at December 31, 2023 and 2024 and September 30, 2025, if equity prices had
increased/decreased by 10% and all other variables were held constant, post-tax
other comprehensive income for the year/period would increase/decrease by
approximately RMB28,433,000, RMB29,934,000 and RMB38,807,000 (unaudited)
respectively and the equity other than investment revaluation reserve would remain
unchanged.

The sensitivity analysis has been determined by assuming that the price change had
occurred at the reporting date and has been applied to the Group’s investments at
that date. In the management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative
of the inherent price risk as the exposure at the end of the reporting period does not
reflect the exposure during the year.

**_Credit risk and impairment assessment_**

Credit risk refers to the risk that the Group’s counterparties default on their
contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Group. The Group’s credit
risk exposures are primarily attributable to trade and bills receivables, deposits and
other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and restricted bank deposits. The
Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover its credit
risks associated with its financial assets.

The Group performed impairment assessment for financial assets and other items
under ECL model. Information about the Group’s credit risk management,
maximum credit risk exposures and the related impairment assessment, if
applicable, are summarized as below:

_Trade and bills receivables_

In order to minimize the credit risk, the management of the Group has delegated a
team responsible for determination of credit limits and credit approvals. Other
monitoring procedures are in place to ensure that follow-up action is taken to
recover overdue debts. In addition, the Group performs impairment assessment
under ECL model upon application of IFRS 9 based on individually assessment for
significant balances and on provision matrix for the remaining.

The Group’s concentration of credit risk on trade receivables by geographical
locations is mainly in the PRC. As at December 31, 2023 and 2024 and September 30,
2025, the Group has concentration of credit risk as 34.0%, 36.3% and 18.0%
(unaudited) of the gross trade receivables was due from the Group’s largest debtor
respectively and 69.3%, 76.4% and 62.9% (unaudited) of the gross trade receivables
was due from the Group’s five largest debtors respectively. In order to minimize the
credit risk, the management of the Group has delegated a team responsible for
determination of credit limits and credit approvals.
