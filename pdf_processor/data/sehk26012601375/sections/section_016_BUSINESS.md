-----

During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we have
continuously upgraded our existing production facilities to address growing demand and
the evolving specifications and requirements of automotive lighting systems and related
optoelectronic components. Key initiatives include enhancing the automation and
digitalization levels of our core domestic facilities, while optimizing production processes
through in-house tooling development, flexible production lines and AI-driven quality
control systems.

According to forecasts by Frost & Sullivan, the market size of the automotive
lighting industry in China and globally is expected to reach RMB168.6 billion and
RMB450.5 billion, respectively, by 2030. To further expand our business scale, meet the
increasing demands of our customers, and capture the significant opportunities in the
global automotive lighting and optoelectronic components markets, we plan to deploy

**Production Process**

All of our manufacturing facilities adhere to established production standards and
procedures, ensuring consistency, quality and efficiency across our operations.


-----

Building on this standardization foundation, we are generally able to meet
customers’ specific requirements by making minor adjustments to the basic structures of
components. For example, we can configure components into common platforms, onto
which customized modules can be layered to achieve diversified product adaptation.
Conversely, when certain integrated functions are no longer required, the relevant
components can be flexibly removed without redesigning the entire module, significantly
enhancing the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of product iteration.

Given the high degree of similarity among the basic structure of key components,
production lines can switch between different customized products with only limited
tooling or program adjustments, substantially reducing changeover time. This is
particularly important during rapid vehicle model iterations or product phase-outs,
enabling smooth production line transitions with minimal downtime or large-scale
modifications, thereby optimizing equipment utilization and mitigating risks arising from
market fluctuations. At the same time, standardization facilitates the extensive
application of automation equipment, allowing robots, vision inspection systems and
automated assembly systems to operate stably and efficiently with reduced manual
intervention. We embed the concept of “design for automated production” at the product
design stage, adhere to DFM/DFA principles, and continuously optimize production line
layouts and process equipment to meet the technical requirements of high-level
automated manufacturing.

**Production Automation**

According to Frost & Sullivan, we have established a first-tier intelligent
manufacturing systems in China’s automotive lighting industry, characterized by high
degree of automation, end-to-end digitalization and deep integration with Internet of
Things (IoT) technologies. This system has achieved industry-leading levels of efficiency,
consistency, and quality, and is capable of rapidly responding to the diversified and
high-frequency model change requirements typical of the new energy vehicle era.

We extensively deploy automated production lines and industrial and collaborative
robots across our manufacturing processes to undertake operations that are highly
repetitive, require high precision, or involve demanding operating environments (such as
multi-color injection molding, automated adhesive dispensing and spray painting, laser
welding, friction welding and vacuum coating), significantly reducing human error and
ensuring product consistency.

comprehensive risk management strategies to mitigate the impact of such volatility. These
measures primarily include entering into new price agreements at the beginning of each
year and making timely price adjustments during the year based on changes in
commodity prices and foreign exchange rates.

We formulate our procurement plans mainly based on factors such as production
plans, inventory levels, supplier lead times and product life-cycle volumes, with detailed
operating guidelines set out in our internal Procurement Planning Management Policy.
Based on these procurement plans, we prudently select the most appropriate raw material
suppliers.

Our supply chain management covers the entire process from demand planning to
delivery. The supply chain management department conducts inquiries, bidding and
price verification through the SRM system, and selects suppliers by comprehensively
considering factors such as price, quality and delivery timelines. We initiate periodic price
negotiations for confirmed raw materials, determining reasonable prices with suppliers
based on comprehensive market research and competitive bidding processes. For the
development of new materials, we similarly carry out new supplier development through
the SRM system, covering the full process from internal review and potential supplier
assessment, system onboarding and qualification review, to new project bidding,
development and mass production. Our suppliers onboarding is required to comply with
the above procedures, enabling us to flexibly activate alternative materials or switch
suppliers in the event of severe shortages or significant price volatility of specific raw
materials.

To manage the risks associated with raw material price fluctuations, we regularly
review raw material prices, benchmark them against commodity trends and market
conditions and make timely adjustments. We determine production volumes based on
sales volumes and use these to cover procurement requirements for our major raw
materials. Procurement plans are synchronized to suppliers through the SRM system, and
suppliers execute deliveries accordingly. In addition, based on inventory structure, future
sales expectations and market trends, we proactively adjust safety stock levels to ensure
the stability and resilience of our supply chain operations.

**Our Suppliers**

We have established stringent supplier selection, evaluation and management
procedures to ensure that all suppliers meet our quality and performance standards. In

meetings to conduct retrospective analyses of major quality issues and prevent their
occurrence or recurrence.

**WAREHOUSING AND LOGISTICS**

We are committed to developing an efficient and transparent logistics supply chain
to ensure customer satisfaction and enhance inventory efficiency. We continuously refine
and standardize warehousing and distribution systems across our self-operated global
warehouses, while also effectively managing third-party logistics providers. As of the
Latest Practicable Date, we operated four self-operated warehouses in the PRC and one
self-operated warehouse in Serbia. In addition, we utilized 32 third-party warehouses in
the PRC and one third-party warehouse in Slovenia. These warehouses are strategically
located in proximity to customers to enhance service delivery and better meet customer
requirements.


-----

The principal terms of our agreements with third-party warehousing service
providers are summarized as follows:

-  _Term. Typically one year._

-  _Principal rights and obligations. Generally, third-party warehousing service_
providers are responsible for warehousing services, including sorting,
inbound handling, storage and outbound dispatch of goods in accordance
with our instructions. We are generally responsible for product packaging and
designate personnel to handle reconciliation, payment and coordination with
such providers.

-  _Payment. Typically settled on a monthly basis._

-  _Quality. Third-party warehousing service providers are required to ensure_
proper warehouse management and comply with our prescribed warehouse
management rules and evaluation standards.

-  _Termination. We generally reserve the right to unilaterally terminate such_
agreements by giving one month’s prior notice, depending on operational
needs.

We utilize a transportation management system (TMS) that standardizes online
operations from order placement to product delivery, facilitating seamless coordination
from manufacturing facilities to customers. The TMS enables us to shorten supply chain
cycles, reduce finished goods inventory and improve inventory turnover, while achieving
information sharing and transparency among the Company, carriers and customers.

We have fully deployed and deeply integrated WMS to standardize warehouse
operations and enhance the accuracy, traceability and responsiveness of inventory

We have also adopted a centralized bidding model to engage high-quality
transportation service providers, supplemented by comprehensive management and
performance indicator systems to ensure service quality. Through continuous
improvement initiatives, we consistently enhance delivery timeliness and accuracy,
improve customer satisfaction and control costs. During the Track Record Period and up
to the Latest Practicable Date, we did not encounter any material delays or mishandling of
goods that had a material adverse impact on our business operations.

**INVENTORY MANAGEMENT**

Our supply chain management is well-coordinated, with the objective of achieving
synergies and optimal resource allocation across various processes, including order
placement, procurement management, product manufacturing and transportation. We
manage and maintain adequate inventory levels to support production. Our procurement
strategies are formulated based on analyses of forecasted supply, market conditions, and
anticipated fluctuations in procurement volumes and purchase prices. Based on such
analyses, we set different reasonable and safe inventory levels for different categories of
inventory to respond to changes in customer demand and fluctuations in raw material
prices.

Our management places strong emphasis on inventory management and holds
quarterly meetings to review asset management issues encountered, propose
improvement plans and objectives, and reassess such plans and objectives at subsequent
quarterly meetings. In addition, we have established strict rules and standards for
inventory management workflows, including (i) inventory arrangement and placement,
(ii) environmental and safety requirements, (iii) storage, (iv) outbound handling, (v)
handling of non-conforming products, (vi) storage and inspection, (vii) inventory
administration and (viii) transfer procedures. We further achieve digitalization and
standardization of inventory management through the integration of ERP, MES and WMS
systems, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of our inventory management
processes.

Our inventory turnover days for 2023, 2024 and the nine months ended September

-----

_Governance_

We have established a top-down climate governance structure and formulated the
Carbon Emissions Management Manual, which sets out our policies, targets, and
overarching requirements for the operation of the carbon emissions management system.
The Board, as the highest leadership and decision-making body, is responsible for guiding
and overseeing the formulation and enhancement of climate-related strategies, as well as
the implementation of climate response actions. A Carbon Emission Promotion Office, led
by the General Manager, has been established to formulate climate change response
targets, plans, and implementation measures, promote the execution of relevant
initiatives, and regularly review progress against these targets. The achievement of
climate-related management objectives has been incorporated into the performance
assessment and incentive mechanisms of senior management, with performance-based
remuneration linked to indicators such as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,
improvements in energy efficiency, and increases in the proportion of renewable energy
usage, thereby encouraging senior management to actively promote the achievement of
climate goals.

_Strategy and Approach_

Through scenario analysis based on the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (“NZE
**2050”) scenario, we have assessed the potential impacts of the global transition towards**
net-zero emissions on the automotive lighting manufacturing industry. We have identified
the following climate-related risks and opportunities and formulated corresponding
mitigation and response measures to enhance climate resilience.

-  Physical risks. Climate change has increased the frequency and severity of
extreme temperatures and weather events, including heatwaves, heavy
rainfall, and flooding. Our manufacturing bases are located in Changzhou,
Foshan, and Serbia, which may be exposed to typhoons, extreme rainfall, and
other weather-related disruptions during flood seasons, posing risks of
production suspension and potential impacts on order fulfillment. To mitigate
these risks, we have proactively implemented measures such as flexible
production scheduling arrangements and the establishment of emergency raw
material reserves, which are expected to substantially reduce potential
adverse financial impacts arising from extreme weather events.

-  Transition risks. As governments worldwide continue to strengthen carbon
reduction policies and promote the development of low-carbon technologies,
demand from consumers and automotive manufacturers for low-energy and
low-carbon products is expected to increase significantly. As a result, we may
be exposed to transition risks, including legal and regulatory risks,
technological risks, market risks, and reputational risks. The Group may be
required to make additional investments in production equipment upgrades
and technological transformation, which could lead to increased production
costs in the short to medium term. To address these challenges, we have
established a policy monitoring team to maintain proactive communication
with policymakers and to formulate response strategies in advance, including


-----

technology innovation and adjustments to our business models. We continue
to increase investments in environmental protection technologies, including
low-energy production equipment, environmental protection facilities, and
process optimization, to reduce carbon emissions and pollutants generated
during production. In addition, we conduct carbon audits and product carbon
footprint certifications to advance our carbon neutrality objectives and to
ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and the expectations of
stakeholders.

-  Climate-related opportunities. Electricity is our primary energy source. By
improving energy efficiency and optimizing our energy mix to reduce reliance
on fossil fuels, we expect to significantly reduce energy costs in the medium to
long term, thereby enhancing profitability. Furthermore, through investments
in the R&D of low-energy automotive lighting products to reduce carbon
emissions during the use phase, we are well-positioned to capture
opportunities in the green automotive market and enhance our market
competitiveness and brand image.

To enhance climate resilience and achieve our climate objectives, we promote
low-carbon transformation across the entire product lifecycle, including direct operations,
upstream value chains, and downstream value chains. We have implemented a series of
energy-saving and emission-reduction measures at our production facilities, including
optimizing energy management, adopting high-efficiency equipment, and introducing
intelligent manufacturing technologies. We are also actively increasing the use of
renewable energy to gradually reduce the carbon footprint of our direct operations. We
are also committed to designing green products. In accordance with ISO 14067 and PAS
2050 standards, we have calculated the carbon footprint of certain core products to
identify potential for emission reduction, optimize product design to minimize material
usage, and mitigate environmental impacts throughout the product lifecycle. In addition,
we have extended climate change management to upstream supply chain activities by
requiring major suppliers to comply with our environmental policies and greenhouse gas
reduction standards. We also regularly assess and enhance suppliers’ environmental
performance and capabilities, thereby jointly addressing climate change challenges.

_Risk Management_

We have formulated the Risk and Opportunity Control Procedures under the
Carbon Emissions Management System to identify potential climate-related risks and
opportunities arising from our operations and to ensure dynamic management of short-,
medium-, and long-term climate-related risks and opportunities through a rolling
management approach. We conduct climate risk and opportunity identification exercises
at least once a year, assess the potential impacts and prioritize the identified risks, and
formulate corresponding mitigation measures based on the risk levels. These measures are
integrated into the operation of the carbon emissions management system, and the
outcomes are reported to the Board on a regular basis.

_Product Quality and Safety_

In accordance with international standards such as IATF 16949, ISO/SAE 21434 and
ISO 26262, we have established and implemented a comprehensive set of quality
management procedures covering R&D management, incoming material inspection,
product inspection and testing, product protection, non-conforming product control,
product recall and continuous improvement. Quality risks are strictly controlled
throughout the entire product lifecycle, and our intelligent manufacturing systems enable
efficient and precise quality management, enhancing product consistency and reliability.

We comply with REACH, GADSL and other applicable regulations governing
hazardous substances and customer requirements, and have established a control system
for restricted and prohibited substances in accordance with our Restricted and Prohibited
Substances Management Policy to ensure product safety. We also value customer feedback
and have established the Voice of Customer Management Policy and Customer
Satisfaction Control Procedure to analyze feedback and complaints and implement
continuous improvements. During the Track Record Period, there were no product recalls
in the end market arising from product quality defects.

**_Anti-corruption_**

We attach great importance to business ethics and anti-corruption management. We
comply with laws and regulations, including the Company Law and the Anti-Unfair
Competition Law of the People’s Republic of China, and have formulated policies such as
the Supervision Management Policy, Internal Control Inspection and Supervision Policy,
and Integrity Commitment under the Sunshine Project to strengthen process control and
audit supervision. Requirements relating to anti-fraud, anti-corruption, and conflict of
interest are extended to directors, all employees and business partners.

We actively promote an ethical business culture and provide regular anti-fraud,
anti-corruption, and integrity training for directors and employees. This includes
anti-corruption training for Board members, integrity and transparency training for
frontline employees, compliance training for key positions, and induction training for
new employees. During the Track Record Period, training coverage for business ethics and
anti-corruption reached 100% for directors and employees.

We adopt a zero-tolerance approach to misconduct and have established multiple
reporting channels, including hotlines, email and internal digital platforms. All reports
are investigated thoroughly, and substantiated cases of fraud or bribery are handled
strictly, with relevant misconduct records duly recorded in individual integrity files. We
strictly protect the confidentiality of whistleblowers and prohibit any form of retaliation.
During the Track Record Period, there were no litigation cases involving corruption.

**_Community Engagement and Public Welfare_**

As a responsible corporate citizen, we give back to the community through
long-term and systematic public welfare and volunteer activities, including voluntary
blood donation, care for vulnerable groups and child welfare initiatives. In 2024, our total
external charitable donations amounted to RMB6.0 million.

In March 2025, we organized our 17th Voluntary Blood Donation Campaign, at
which approximately 214,000 c.c. of blood were donated. To date, the cumulative blood
donation volume has exceeded two million c.c..

**REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS**

**Legal Proceedings**

We may, from time to time, be subject to various legal or administrative claims and
proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business. Litigation or any other legal or

costs and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time and attention. As

court, arbitral or administrative proceedings which we believe may be of material
importance to our assets and liabilities or profits and losses, nor, so far as we are aware,
are any such proceedings pending or threatened. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to
Our Business and Industry — We, our Directors, management, employees and
shareholders and their affiliates may be subject to lawsuits, contract disputes,
employment-related controversies and other legal and administrative proceedings or
fine.”

During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we had not
been and were not involved in any material non-compliance incidents that have led to
fines, enforcement actions, or other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

procedures relate to managing our procurement and production, as well as monitoring
our sales performance and product quality.

price and currency risks, ensuring that all hedging activities are conducted
within a structured and consistent framework;
