significant price uncertainty. Fluctuations in upstream raw material prices are transmitted
to midstream manufacturers, thereby exerting a certain impact on their product cost
control and profitability.


-----

**Entry Barriers in the Automotive Lighting Industry**

**_Customer Barriers_**

As critical functional safety components and core elements of intelligent vehicle
systems, automotive lighting products require deep integration with vehicle platforms,
electronic/electrical (E/E) architecture and strict safety standards. This technical
interdependence underpins long-term collaboration between lighting suppliers and
automotive manufacturers, solidifying incumbents’ market position. Amid faster vehicle
development cycles, automotive manufacturers increasingly favor established partners to
reduce coordination, communication and procurement costs. New entrants, typically
lacking co-development experience, must complete a rigorous automotive manufacturer
or third-party qualification process (2–3 years on average) to attain approved supplier
status, creating substantial barriers to securing program nominations and ramping up
mass production/delivery on schedule.

**_Technical Barriers_**

The technological scope of automotive lighting has expanded beyond conventional
optical and structural design to a multidisciplinary integration of semiconductor light
sources, precision optics, automotive-grade electronic control, thermal management,
functional safety, software algorithms and system integration. Intelligent lighting
products with pixel-level projection — such as HD and DLP lighting — demand high
response speed, precise light control and robust reliability. They must also deeply
coordinate with ADAS, the vehicle’s electronic/electrical (E/E) architecture and
SOA-based software platforms, while supporting OTA updates and scenario-based
interactive functions. Building such a technology system requires sustained R&D
investment, cross-domain expertise and extensive validation through real-world vehicle
data — capabilities that new entrants cannot easily replicate in the short term.

**_Cost Barriers_**

The cost barriers in the automotive lighting industry primarily stem from high
initial capital requirements and the need for economies of scale to absorb fixed costs.
Manufacturing automotive lighting typically demands dedicated production lines for
high-precision injection molding, vacuum coating, automated assembly and optical
inspection, with each line often costing over RMB100 million level. Bringing a new
product from development to mass production also incurs significant upfront expenses
for molds, tooling, prototypes, reliability testing and functional safety certifications.
These costs are incurred early and recovered over time. Only companies with stable order
volumes and large-scale manufacturing can sufficiently spread these costs and achieve
profitability. New entrants or smaller manufacturers, constrained by lower production
volumes, generally cannot benefit from such economies of scale.


-----

**_Product Certification Barriers_**

The product certification barriers in the automotive lighting industry mainly stem
from quality certifications and automotive manufacturer supplier qualifications. As a
critical component directly impacting driving safety, automotive lighting products must
comply with mandatory technical regulations, industry standards, quality management
systems and functional safety certifications across different markets. These processes are
complex, time-consuming and costly. Additionally, automotive manufacturers impose
stringent requirements on reliability, consistency and safety, requiring suppliers to pass
rigorous assessments and audits before approval. Together, these certification and
qualification hurdles significantly limit new entrants’ ability to quickly establish
themselves in the industry.

**Drivers of the Automotive Lighting Market**

**_Policy-Driven Factors_**

The global policy and regulatory environment is actively driving the accelerated
technological upgrading of the automotive lighting industry. In Europe, the automotive
lighting standard system centers on UN R48, UN R148 and UN R149, which incorporate
proposals on front part light carpets, reversing lamps and turn signal projection. In North
America, SAE standards framework specifies road test requirements for ADB functions
and adds requirements for front, rear and side ADS marker lamps. China’s automotive
lighting standards, primarily GB 4785-2019, GB 4599-2024 and GB 5920-2024, explicitly
support vehicle light carpets and optical signaling projection, and permit the use of laser
headlights. Moreover, South America and other emerging automotive markets are
continuously strengthening safety and energy efficiency regulations for automotive
lighting, thereby providing an institutional foundation for product compliance and
market expansion.

**_Rapid Growth in NEV Sales Drives Higher Lighting Value per Vehicle_**

With ongoing advances in automotive electrification and intelligence, China’s NEV
penetration rate has continued to rise, reaching 40.9% in 2024 and is expected to grow
rapidly further. NEVs offer greater design freedom, more advanced electrical
architectures and distinctive styling, making them more likely to adopt high-value
lighting products such as ISD, HD and DLP lighting. As a result, NEVs have significantly

chain.

**Embodied Intelligence Industry Overview**

**Background of Development**

Intelligent vehicles and embodied intelligence exhibit a strong degree of correlation,
with embodied intelligence representing one of the most compelling physical carriers of
future Physical AI. Leveraging the automotive sector as an entry point to develop
embodied intelligence has become an emerging industry trend, driven by both deep
technological commonality and structural growth imperatives. Major automotive
component suppliers are increasingly expanding into the robotics sector, seeking to
systematically transfer core capabilities accumulated in the automotive industry — such
as system engineering, reliability and large-scale manufacturing — into robotics, thereby
creating new growth curves and differentiated competitive advantages.

The high-reliability standards, large-scale cost control capabilities and system-level
engineering experience inherent to the automotive components industry are precisely
what embodied intelligence requires to transition from demonstration to stable, scalable
deployment. This convergence is expected to accelerate industry maturation and
commercial adoption.

**Current Development Status of Embodied Intelligence and Component Industries**

**Definition**

Embodied intelligence is a frontier field formed through the interdisciplinary
integration of artificial intelligence with multiple scientific domains. Its core lies in
intelligent systems that achieve intelligent evolution through physical embodiment and
real-world interaction. It emphasizes the deep integration of perception, action and
cognition, enabling intelligent agents to interact with their environments — much like
humans — learning and evolving through trial and error. Embodied intelligence relies not
only on computing power, but also emphasizes real-time interaction between the
“physical embodiment” and the environment, forming a closed-loop system of
“perception-decision-action”.

**Application Landscape**

In China, embodied intelligence applications span a wide range of scenarios,
including industrial manufacturing, logistics and material handling, commercial services,
household services, medical rehabilitation, special operations, education and training,
scientific research and agriculture. Among these, industrial manufacturing and logistics
represent the largest addressable markets due to their relatively structured environments
and higher technological maturity, making them the earliest domains to achieve
commercial deployment. Driven by e-commerce and new retail, logistics and material
handling scenarios have already seen large-scale adoption. Commercial services — such
as retail, catering and hospitality — are currently in a rapid penetration and
scenario-validation phase, with embodied intelligence deployed in roles including
shopping mall guidance, restaurant delivery and hotel reception. Household services
remain in an early market-education stage. Medical rehabilitation, characterized by high
value and high entry barriers, is undergoing technology integration and pilot
deployment. In special operations, embodied intelligence demonstrates irreplaceable
value. Meanwhile, education and training serve both as application tools and research
carriers across scientific and basic education contexts.

Overall, embodied intelligence is accelerating its expansion from structured to
unstructured environments, and from industrial to commercial and household
applications. The industry has moved beyond proof-of-concept and entered a critical
phase of scalable commercialization, with the next 3–5 years expected to represent a key
window for exponential growth.

**Key Development Challenges**

At present, the optoelectronic segment of embodied intelligence faces challenges
related to functional completeness and standardization gaps. Components must meet
requirements for high-precision sensing, flexible interaction and safety protection, while
also addressing aesthetic design and scenario adaptability. Demand for optoelectronic
components in embodied intelligence is systemic and rigid, evolving from basic
functionality toward enhanced safety and user experience. The entry of automotive
lighting manufacturers into the embodied intelligence sector is therefore a natural result
of demand alignment and capability matching.

Embodied intelligence and intelligent vehicles share highly homologous
requirements and currently serve as the primary testing ground for innovation in optical
perception and human–machine interaction. Both face similar technical challenges,
including mobile perception, human–robot coexistence and emotional expression.
Lighting standards are among the most critical mandatory national standards in the
automotive industry and provide valuable reference for robots that likewise require
“optical organs” for perception and interaction. Core competencies of automotive lighting
suppliers — such as optical design, precision manufacturing, automotive-grade reliability
and collaborative development with automotive manufacturers — directly address these
challenges.


-----

In the absence of mature industry standards, automotive lighting suppliers are well
positioned to introduce high-reliability, high-safety system design philosophies and
testing standards into robotics, potentially becoming key contributors to the future
standardization of robotic “sensory systems.”
