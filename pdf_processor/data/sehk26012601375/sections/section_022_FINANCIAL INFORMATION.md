**BASIS OF PREPARATION**

The International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) has issued a number of
new and revised IFRS Accounting Standards. For the purpose of preparing this historical
financial information, we have adopted all applicable new and revised IFRS Accounting
Standards to the Track Record Period. The new and revised accounting standards and
interpretations issued but not yet effective for the accounting period beginning on
January 1, 2025 are set out in Note 2 to the Accountants’ Report in Appendix I to this
document.

The historical financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis
except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each
reporting period and a summary of the material accounting policy information has been
set out as explained in Note 3 to the Accountants’ Report in Appendix I to this document.

In the application of our accounting policies, our directors are required to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Such key sources of estimation
uncertainty are discussed in Note 4 to the Accountants’ Report in Appendix I to this
document.

**KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

Our results of operations and financial conditions have been, and will continue to
be, materially affected by a number of factors, some of which are outside our control,
including:

-  development of macroeconomic conditions;

-  government policies and regulations in relation to the automotive lighting
products and the automotive industry;

-  evolving consumption patterns and habits in China and globally;

-  continuous growth and evolving competitive landscape of the automotive
lighting products and automotive industry; and

-  technology development of intelligent driving and automated driving in
recent years, which contributed to the growing demand for automotive
electronics and intelligent automotive lighting products.

In addition to the general factors, we believe the following company-specific factors
also have a significant impact on our results of operations.


-----

**_Ability to Maintain and Engage Customers and Seize Market Opportunities_**

Our business growth is driven by our ability to expand our customer base and
maintain our relationships with existing customers. We serve high-quality automotive
manufacturers globally. We optimize resource allocation efficiently across various
regions, enabling us to provide automotive manufacturers with superior R&D, supply
chain and production solutions both in China market and on a global scale, while also
ensuring rapid and effective local response. According to Frost & Sullivan, we have
established business relationships with nine of the world’s top ten automotive
manufacturers by vehicle sales volume calculated on a group level in 2024.

Our future growth will depend on our abilities to identify and capitalize on major
market opportunities, including the increasing penetration of NEVs, the rising market
share of Chinese domestic brands, and the international expansion of Chinese automotive
manufacturers. By leveraging our competitive advantages in localization and our network
of synergistic factories, we have successfully strengthened our presence in the Chinese
market, with particular focus on leading domestic brands and NEV manufacturers. Our
continued R&D investment and deep involvement in automotive lighting products and
relevant components has also enabled us to substantially expand our product portfolio
and secure orders.

**_R&D Capabilities and Product Upgrades_**

Our R&D capabilities in developing and enhancing new technologies, products are
fundamental to our business operations and financial performance. We officially took the
lead in initiating and releasing China’s first ISO standard project for automotive lighting,
filling the gap in international standards in this field. Our research and development
expenses amounted to RMB610.2 million, RMB655.5 million, RMB463.1 million and
RMB640.6 million in 2023, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025,
respectively, accounting for 6.0%, 4.9%, 5.0% and 6.0% of our revenue for the relevant
years/periods, respectively. We are committed to long-term investment in R&D activities
and our historical R&D investment continue to translate into commercial success,
allowing us to benefit from economies of scale in R&D activities. We have made, and will
continue to make, significant investments in people, technology and R&D, to reinforce the
leadership in our technology and gross profit margin, thereby solidifying our market
leadership and providing great customer experience. We have established a
comprehensive global R&D system, which we consider the key driver of our sales and
profitability.

We have strong full-stack in-house R&D capabilities. Our R&D capabilities span five
core fields: optics, mechanics, electronics, software and materials. Guided by in-depth
insights into client needs, we carry out creative styling design and co-creation of
automotive lighting application scenarios. Through rigorous optical system design and
simulation, and under the drive of parameterized software algorithms, these solutions are
integrated into precision-engineered structural components to deliver intelligent
automotive lighting solutions that support illumination, projection-based interaction and
display functions. To address the requirements of diverse application scenarios, we also
collaborate with upstream suppliers to develop specialized polymer materials tailored for
automotive lighting applications.


-----

With the objective of achieving end-to-end digital integration across the entire value
chain and intelligent operations, we continue to advance our digital transformation,
focusing on two principal directions: “end-to-end value chain business process
optimization” and “digital benchmark factory development.” In terms of business
processes, we promote the digitalization of R&D, operations and decision-making, and
have established a full-scale digital system. Its core value lies in optimizing resource
allocation, improving cross-departmental efficiency, supporting production, operation
and management decision-making and controlling operating costs. See “Business —
Information Technology” for details. For example, our supply chain management covers
the entire process from demand planning to delivery. The supply chain management
department conducts inquiries, bidding and price verification through the SRM system,
and selects suppliers by comprehensively considering factors such as price, quality and
delivery timelines. See “Business — Raw Materials and Suppliers” for details.

As we further expand our production, we will continue to implement various cost
control measures and maintain the high efficiency and stability with respect to supply
chain, production, R&D and other process. We will also actively leverage our vertically
integrated operating model of in-house design and production capacities, together with
our end-to-end digitalized integration management system, to further unleash economies
of scale, thereby sustaining high revenue growth.

**_Our Management of Trade and Bills Receivables_**

Our capability to manage the level of trade and bills receivables will affect our cash
level and liquidity as well as our financial condition. We value the managing of
receivables and have established a comprehensive and effective system for management
and tracking our trade and bills receivables, along with a corresponding customer credit
management and assessment regime. This system integrates preventive controls, such as
credit assessment, with active process management. For example, our senior management
regularly reviews the recoverability of our outstanding balances, and we have a dedicated
department responsible for continually monitoring the credit profiles as well as operating
and financial condition of our customers. Our trade receivables turnover days in 2023,
2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were 77 days, 103 days and 105 days,
respectively. We believe that as we continue to strengthen our customer partnerships and
enhance our receivables management mechanisms, we will maintain efficient receivables
management, thereby supporting our business liquidity.


-----

**_Inventory Management_**

Effective inventory management is essential for maintaining the sustainability and
flexibility of our production, as well as enabling us to swiftly respond to fluctuations in
market demand. We formulate procurement strategies based on supply forecasts, market
analysis, and the estimates of fluctuations in procurement years/periods and prices, and
regularly monitor the inventory balance and consumption, enabling us to maintain a
reasonable and safe inventory level to respond to changes in customer demand and raw
material price fluctuations. During the production process, we have deeply integrated the
WMS with the MES to achieve end-to-end coordinated material control from planning to
execution.

The globalization of our supply chain, production bases and warehouses allow us to
manage our inventory with flexibility and adaptability, thereby reducing overstocking
costs and enhancing the efficiency of inventory management, which in turn enables us to
respond swiftly to the needs of customers in different regions. Our inventory turnover
days in 2023, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were 101 days, 82 days
and 82 days, respectively.

We further achieve digitalization and standardization of inventory management
through the integration of ERP, MES and WMS systems, thereby improving the efficiency
and accuracy of our inventory management processes.

**MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES**
**AND JUDGMENTS**

We have identified certain accounting policies that are material to the preparation of
our financial information. Some of our accounting policies involve subjective assumptions
and estimates, as well as complex judgments relating to accounting items. In each case, the
determination of these items requires management judgments based on information and
financial data that may change in future years/periods. There has not been any material
deviation from our management’s estimates or assumptions and actual results, and we
have not made any material changes to these estimates or assumptions during the Track
Record Period. We do not expect any material changes to these estimates and assumptions
in the foreseeable future. When reviewing our financial information, you should consider
amendments to accounting standards, implementation of new standards and changes in
accounting policies may also require us to adjust the presentation of our financial
statements, which could materially impact the comparability of our financial metrics and
our financial results of operations.

We believe that the (i) material accounting information in relation to revenue from
contracts with customers, financial instruments, property, plant and equipment, as
detailed in Note 3 to the Accountants’ Report set out in Appendix I to this Document and
(ii) accounting judgments and estimates including allowance for ECL on trade and bills
receivables, as set out in details in Note 4 to the Accountants’ Report set out in Appendix
I to this Document are critical and/or involve the most important estimates and
judgments we used in preparing our financial statements.


-----

**Material Accounting Policies**

**_Revenue from contracts with customers_**

We recognize revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when
“control” of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is
transferred to the customers.

A performance obligation represents a good or service (or a bundle of goods or
services) that is distinct or a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the
same.

Control is transferred over time and revenue is recognized over time by reference to
the progress towards complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation if one
of the following criteria is met:

-  the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by
our performance as we perform;

-  our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as we
perform; or

-  our performance do not create an asset with an alternative use to us and we
have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.

Otherwise, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains
control of the distinct good or service.

A contract asset represents our right to consideration in exchange for goods or
services that we have transferred to a customer that is not yet unconditional. It is assessed
for impairment in accordance with IFRS 9. In contrast, a receivable represents our
unconditional right to consideration, i.e. only the passage of time is required before
payment of that consideration is due. A contract liability represents our obligation to
transfer goods or services to a customer for which we have received consideration (or an
amount of consideration is due) from the customer.

Information about our accounting policies relating to revenue from contracts with
customers is provided in Note 5 to the Accountants’ Report in Appendix I to this
Document.

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment are tangible assets that are held for use in the
production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes (other than
freehold lands and construction in progress as described below). Property, plant and
equipment are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost less
subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses, if
any.


-----

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash
receipts and payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral
part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts)
through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability, or, where appropriate,
a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

**_Financial assets_**

_Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets_

Financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at
amortized cost:

-  the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect
contractual cash flows; and

-  the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at
fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”):

-  the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved
by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets; and

-  the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

All other financial assets are subsequently measured at FVTPL, except that at initial
recognition of a financial asset we may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in
fair value of an equity instruments in other comprehensive income if that equity
instruments is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognized by an
acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” applies.

A financial asset is held for trading if:

-  it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term; or

-  on initial recognition it is a part of a portfolio of identified financial
instruments that we manage together and have a recent actual pattern of
short-term profit-taking; or

-  it is a derivative that is not a designated and effective hedging instrument.

In addition, we may irrevocably designate a financial asset that are required to be
measured at the amortized cost or FVTOCI as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or
significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.


-----

In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing
whether credit risk has increased significantly:

-  an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument’s
external (if available) or internal credit rating;

-  significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk, e.g. a
significant increase in the credit spread, the credit default swap prices for the
debtor;

-  existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic
conditions that are expected to cause a significant decrease in the debtor’s
ability to meet its debt obligations;

-  an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the
debtor;

-  an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic
or technological environment of the debtor that results in a significant
decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations.

Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, we presume that the credit risk
has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more
than 30 days past due, unless we have reasonable and supportable information that
demonstrates otherwise.

Despite the foregoing, we assume that the credit risk on a debt instrument has not
increased significantly since initial recognition if the debt instrument is determined to
have low credit risk at the reporting date. A debt instrument is determined to have low
credit risk if (i) it has a low risk of default, (ii) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet
its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term and (iii) adverse changes in
economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce
the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations. We consider a
debt instrument to have low credit risk when it has an internal or external credit rating of
“investment grade” as per globally understood definitions.

We regularly monitor the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there
has been a significant increase in credit risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that
the criteria are capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the amount
becomes past due.

(ii) Definition of default

For internal credit risk management, we consider an event of default occurs when
information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the
debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including us, in full (without taking into account
any collaterals held by us).


-----

For collective assessment, we take into consideration the following characteristics
when formulating the grouping:

-  Past-due status;

-  Nature, size and industry of debtors; and

-  External credit ratings where available.

The grouping is regularly reviewed by management to ensure the constituents of
each group continue to share similar credit risk characteristics.

Interest income is calculated based on the gross carrying amount of the financial
asset unless the financial asset is credit-impaired, in which case interest income is
calculated based on amortized cost of the financial asset.

We recognize an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial
instruments by adjusting their carrying amount, with the exception of trade and bills
receivables and other receivables where the corresponding adjustment is recognized
through a loss allowance account.

_Derecognition/modification of financial assets_

We derecognize a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows
from the asset expire.

On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortized cost, the difference
between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and
receivable is recognized in profit or loss.

A modification of a financial asset occurs if the contractual cash flows are
renegotiated or otherwise modified.

When the contractual terms of a financial asset are modified, we assess whether the
revised terms result in a substantial modification from original terms taking into account
all relevant facts and circumstances including qualitative factors. If qualitative
assessment is not conclusive, we consider the terms are substantially different if the
discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid
net of any fees received, and discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at least
10 per cent different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the
original financial asset. For non-substantial modifications of financial assets that do not
result in derecognition, the carrying amount of the relevant financial assets will be
calculated at the present value of the modified contractual cash flows discounted at the
financial assets’ original effective interest rate. Transaction costs or fees incurred are
adjusted to the carrying amount of the modified financial assets and are amortized over
the remaining term. Any adjustment to the carrying amount of the financial asset is
recognized in profit or loss at the date of modification.


-----

_Critical accounting judgements and estimate_

In the application of our accounting policies, which are described in Note 3 to the
Accountants’ Report set out in Appendix I to this Document, our directors are required to
make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and
other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is
revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future
years/periods if the revision affects both current and future years/periods.

_Key sources of estimation uncertainty_

The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources
of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that may have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year.

_Allowance for ECL on trade and bills receivables_

Trade and bills receivables are assessed for ECL using a provision matrix. Trade and
bills receivables with significant balances and credit-impaired are assessed for ECL
individually.

The provision matrix of ECL is sensitive to changes in estimates. The information
about the ECL and our trade and bills receivables are disclosed in note 20 to the
Accountants’ Report set out in Appendix I to this Document.

**Other Gains and Losses, Net**

Our other gains and losses, net primarily include (i) exchange (losses)/gains, net,
and (ii) loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment. In 2023 and 2024 and the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, our other losses, net amounted to RMB5.9 million,
RMB28.2 million and RMB19.9 million, respectively. In the nine months ended September
30, 2025, our other gains, net amounted to RMB4.2 million. The following table sets forth a
breakdown of our other gains and losses, net by nature for the years/periods indicated:

**_Hong Kong Profits Tax_**

Hong Kong profits tax is calculated at 16.5% on the estimated assessable profit
during the Track Record Period.

**_Serbia Corporate Income Tax_**

According to Serbian Corporate Income Tax Law, foreign-invested enterprises with
fixed asset investments of RSD1 billion and creating more than 100 new jobs during the
investment period are exempt from the Corporate Income Tax for 10 years from its first
profit-making year. Xingyu Serbia operating in the Republic of Serbia is eligible for the
concession.

Taxation arising in other jurisdiction is calculated at the rates prevailing in the
relevant jurisdictions.

**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

**Comparison between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30,**
**2025**

**_Revenue_**

Our revenue increased by 16.1% from RMB9,225.5 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 to RMB10,710.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025,
primarily due to the significant growth of our businesses.

Our revenue from automotive lighting products increased by 17.3% from
RMB8,687.2 million to RMB10,191.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2025, respectively, primarily due to growths in sales volume and average selling price
in intelligent automotive lighting products, and in particular, our rear lighting products,
such as ISD and OLED, which completed mass delivery in the nine months ended
September 30, 2025. The aggregate contribution of intelligent front lighting products and
the intelligent rear lighting products in our total automotive lighting products by revenue
increased from 13.6% in the nine months ended as of September 30, 2024 to 16.2% in the
nine months ended as of September 30, 2025. These were driven by (i) an increasing
demand for advanced and intelligent automotive lighting products, and (ii) our continual
R&D efforts and product innovation and upgrading in response to such demand of
intelligent products, thereby enhancing our overall product competitiveness.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Our cost of sales increased by 15.3% from RMB7,494.1 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 to RMB8,644.0 million in the nine months ended September 30,
2025, which was generally in line with our growth in revenue.

**_Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin_**

As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit increased by 19.3% from RMB1,731.3
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to RMB2,065.9 million in the nine


-----

mainly caused by the foreign exchange rate fluctuations between foreign exchange project
settlement rate and the reporting rate at the end of financial period. In the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we recorded losses primarily (i) due to exchange rate
fluctuations and (ii) from the disposal of certain idle assets.

**_Finance Costs_**

Our finance costs increased by 56.6% from RMB4.1 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 to RMB6.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025,
mainly due to increases in our discounting of bills when market interest rates were
favorable.

**_Income Tax Expenses_**

Our income tax expenses increased by 10.2% from RMB115.8 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 to RMB127.7 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2025. Our income tax expense as a percentage of our profit before tax
remained stable at 10.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 10.1% in the
nine months ended September 30, 2025.

**_Profit and Total Comprehensive Income for the Period_**

As a result of the foregoing, our net profit increased by 16.8% from RMB977.2
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to RMB1,141.0 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2025.

**Comparison between year 2024 and 2023**

**_Revenue_**

Our revenue increased by 29.3% from RMB10,248.4 million in 2023 to RMB13,252.9
million in 2024, primarily due to the significant growth of our businesses.

Our revenue from automotive lighting products increased by 30.0% from
RMB9,616.0 million in 2023 to RMB12,500.7 million in 2024, primarily because of growths
in sales volume and average selling price in intelligent automotive lighting products, and
in particular, our front lighting products, such as DLP lights, upon their mass delivery in
2024. The aggregate contribution of intelligent front lighting products and the intelligent
rear lighting products in our total automotive lighting products by revenue also
significantly increased from 0.3% in 2023 to 13.6% in 2024. These were driven by: (i) the
sustained growth of NEV market which drove an explosive growth in demand for
intelligent lighting products; (ii) our continuous efforts in technology and product
innovation and upgrading, and in particular, our strengthened and in-depth cooperation
with both existing and new customers in the PRC and worldwide through participation in
the early development stages (such as design and R&D) of the automotive lighting
products for their vehicle models; and (iii) our enhanced ability to quickly integrate our
production capabilities to fit in more comprehensive production demands of intelligent
automotive lighting products.


-----

**_Cost of Sales_**

Our cost of sales increased by 31.5% from RMB8,152.1 million in 2023 to
RMB10,723.6 million in 2024, which was generally in line with our growth in revenue.

**_Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin_**

As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit increased by 20.7% from RMB2,096.3
million in 2023 to RMB2,529.3 million in 2024. Our gross profit margin decreased from
20.5% in 2023 to 19.1% in 2024. In particular:

The gross profit increased 20.7% from 2023 to 2024, mainly due to (i) our rapid
response to market demand and adjustment of our products portfolio, including the
adaption and upgrading to NEV demands and introduction of more high-end products,
which carried higher average price and sales volume, and (ii) our successful maintaining
and attracting existing customers and NEV customers by offering intelligent automotive
lighting product portfolio. Simultaneously, our gross profit margin slightly decreased
from 20.5% in 2023 to 19.1% in 2024, mainly due to (i) mass delivery of intelligent
automotive lighting products in 2024, which typically involved higher raw materials costs
for the procurement of more structurally complex and higher-value components, and (ii)
intensive competition of our industry further narrowing our gross profit margin while we
are trying to attract and expand our NEV customer group and offering more intelligent
products.

**_Administrative Expenses_**

Our administrative expenses increased by 13.6% from RMB332.8 million in 2023 to
RMB378.0 million in 2024, primarily due to (i) the increase in employee benefit expenses
resulting from the increase in the number of administrative staff to support our business
expansion, (ii) the increase in depreciation and amortization driven by our new office and
administration facilities and software, and (iii) the increase of taxes and surcharges
reflecting the expansion of our business.

**_Selling Expenses_**

Our selling expenses increased by 19.1% from RMB46.8 million in 2023 to RMB55.8
million in 2024, primarily due to (i) the increase in service expenses to facilitate our sales
resulting from to a larger customer base, (ii) the increase in material consumption as a
result of business expansion, and (iii) the increase in rental and storage expenses.


-----

**_Research and Development Expenses_**

Our research and development expenses increased by 7.4% from RMB610.2 million
in 2023 to RMB655.5 million in 2024, primarily attributable to the increases in (i) the
number of our R&D staff to support our R&D activities and their salary and renumeration,
and (ii) the depreciation and amortization driven by purchase of R&D equipment and
software, demonstrating our consistent and dedicated R&D efforts to support the
innovation of our product and to enhance the competitive advantage of our products. Our
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 6.0% in
2023 to 4.9% in 2024, primarily because the growth in our research and development
expenses was outpaced by our revenue growth from 2023 to 2024.

**_Other Income_**

Our other income increased by 34.8% from RMB146.0 million in 2023 to RMB196.8
million in 2024, primarily due to the increases in governmental subsidies and rewards
granted to us in 2024 with respect to our construction of the manufacturing facilities and
R&D centers.

**_Other Losses, Net_**

Our other losses, net increased from RMB5.9 million in 2023 to RMB28.2 million in
2024, mainly due to (i) the relatively high loss caused by the foreign exchange rate
fluctuations between foreign exchange project settlement rate and the reporting rate at the
end of financial period, and (ii) losses from the disposal of certain idle assets, in 2024.

**_Finance Costs_**

Our finance costs increased by 374.1% from RMB1.4 million in 2023 to RMB6.4
million in 2024, mainly because we discounted the bills when the market interest rates
were favorable.

**_Income Tax Expenses_**

Our income tax expenses amounted to RMB101.0 million in 2023 and increased to
RMB184.1 million in 2024. Our income tax expenses as a percentage of our profit before
income tax increased from 8.4% in 2023 to 11.6% in 2024 mainly because R&D-related tax
benefits accounted for a lower portion of profit before income tax in 2024.

**_Profit and Total Comprehensive Income for the Year_**

As a result of the foregoing, our net profit increased by 27.8% from RMB1,102.1
million in 2023 to RMB1,408.3 million in 2024.

Our inventory turnover days decreased from 101 days in 2023 to 82 days in 2024,
primarily because we have implemented and carried out inventory optimization
management measures through the digitalization and standardization of our management
processes, achieved by integrating ERP, MES and WMS systems.

Our inventory turnover days remained stable at 82 days in 2024 and the nine months
ended September 30, 2025, reflecting our operational stability.

As of November 30, 2025, RMB1,393.7 million, or 52.5% of inventories as of
September 30, 2025, had been used, consumed or sold.

_Note:_ We calculate trade receivables turnover days using the average of the beginning and ending
balances of trade receivables for that year/period divided by the corresponding revenue for the
year/period and multiplied by 360 days for a fiscal year and 270 days for a nine months period.

Our trade receivables turnover days increased from 77 days in 2023 to 103 days in
2024, primarily due to the general extension of payment cycle caused by intensified
competition among downstream automotive manufacturer customers. Our trade
receivables turnover days remained relatively stable at 103 days in 2024 and 105 days in
the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

As of November 30, 2025, RMB3,326.1 million, or 51.6% of our trade and bills
receivables as of September 30, 2025, had been settled. During the Track Record Period
and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we did not have any material recoverability issue for
our trade and bills receivables.

**Financial assets at FVTOCI**

Our financial assets at FVTOCI comprise listed and unlisted equity securities which
are not held for trading. These relate to strategic investments in equity securities
measured at FVTOCI quoted in the Stock Exchange, as well as unquoted equity securities
of companies operating in relevant industry sectors for long term strategic purposes. We
recorded RMB335.8 million, RMB353.6 million and RMB543.3 million of financial assets at
FVTOCI as of December 31, 2023, 2024 and as of September 30, 2025. The increase from
RMB353.6 million as of December 31, 2024 to RMB543.3 million as of September 30, 2025,
was primarily due to increases in investment in listed equity securities in 2025.

We have appointed a special team to monitor the price risk in connection with our
strategic investments and will consider hedging such risk exposure if necessary. Our
Directors manage this risk exposure by maintaining a portfolio of investments with
different risk and return profiles and will consider hedging the price risk if necessary.

Upon [REDACTED], we intend to continue our investments strictly in accordance
with our internal policies and procedures, Articles of Association and compliance
requirements under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules.

**Financial Assets at FVTPL**

Our financial assets at FVTPL consist of structure deposits and wealth management
products issued by the banks during the Track Record Period. We recorded RMB1,157.0
million, RMB1,122.4 million and RMB1,452.4 million of financial assets at FVTPL as of
December 31, 2023, 2024 and as of September 30, 2025.

The decrease from RMB1,157.0 million as of December 31, 2023 to RMB1,122.4
million as of December 31, 2024, was primarily due to the maturity of certain structure
deposits and wealth management products issued by banks. The increase from
RMB1,122.4 million as of December 31, 2024 to RMB1,452.4 million as of September 30,
2025, was primarily due to our entry into several new contracts of structured deposits and
wealth management products with commercial banks in 2025.

Our cash management strategy aims to optimize the efficiency of idle funds,
generate investment returns and manage investment and financial risks. Guided by this
strategy, we invest in low-risk structure deposits and wealth management products with
high liquidity and security, offered by reputable commercial banks in China. We have
established a comprehensive set of internal policies and guidelines, pursuant to which our
finance department is responsible for analyzing and evaluating potential investment in
financial assets. Our management have extensive experience in managing financial
investments. Prior to making any material investments, the proposal shall be reviewed
and approved by our chief financial officer. Significant investment decisions will be made
and may be subject to the approvals of our board of directors and/or shareholders
meeting in accordance with our internal policy and procedures, provisions of the articles
of associations.

and payment methods based on procurement volumes in 2025.

Note 37 of the Accountants’ Report in Appendix I to this document was conducted in the
ordinary course of business on an arm’s-length basis and with normal commercial terms

_Trade and bills receivables_

In order to minimize the credit risk, our management has delegated a team
responsible for determination of credit limits and credit approvals. Other monitoring
procedures are in place to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue debts.
In addition, we perform impairment assessment under ECL model upon application of
IFRS 9 based on individually assessment for significant balances and on provision matrix
for the remaining.

Our concentration of credit risk on trade receivables by geographical locations is
mainly in the PRC. As of December 31, 2023, December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025,
our Group has concentration of credit risk as 34.0%, 36.3% and 18.0% of the gross trade
receivables was due from our largest customer respectively and 69.3%, 76.4% and 62.9% of
the gross trade receivables was due from our five largest customers respectively. In order
to minimize the credit risk, our management has delegated a team responsible for
determination of credit limits and credit approvals.

_Deposits and receivables_

For deposits and receivables, our management makes periodic individual
assessment on the recoverability of deposits and receivables based on historical
settlement records, past experience, and also quantitative and qualitative information that
is reasonable and supportive forward-looking information. The management believes that
there are no significant increase in credit risk of these amounts since initial recognition
and we provided impairment based on 12-month ECL.

_Cash and cash equivalents and restricted bank deposits_

Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and restricted bank deposits is limited
because the counterparties are reputable banks with high credit ratings assigned by credit
agencies. We assessed 12-month ECL for cash and cash equivalents and restricted bank
deposits by reference to information relating to probability of default and loss given
default of the respective credit rating grades published by external credit rating agencies.
Based on the average loss rates, the 12-month ECL on cash and cash equivalents and
restricted bank deposits is considered to be insignificant and therefore no loss allowance
was recognized.

**Liquidity Risk**

In the management of the liquidity risk, we monitor and maintain a level of cash and
cash equivalents deemed adequate by the management to finance our operations and
mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.

**DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND POLICY**

Our Company declared dividends of RMB314.2 million, RMB397.3 million and
RMB426.5 million in respect of the financial years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024 and
the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

the characteristics of the industry we are engaged in, the stage of development, our
business model, the level of profitability, the ability to repay debts, whether there are
arrangements for major capital expenditures, and returns to investors. The Board should
assess the stage of development that we are in and the arrangements for significant capital
expenditure and, in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Articles of
Association of our Company, put forward a differentiated cash dividend policy.

Our future declarations of dividends may not be in line with our historical
declaration of dividends and will be subject to the approval of our Shareholders. See “Risk
