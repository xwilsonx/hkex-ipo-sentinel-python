concerning future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Those assumptions and factors
are based on information currently available to us about the businesses that we operate.

could influence actual results include, but are not limited to:

-  future developments, trends and conditions in the industry and markets in
which we operate or into which we intend to expand;

-  changes in local economic and political conditions and changes in compliance
with international laws and regulations in the countries and regions where we
operate;

-  our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategies; our
planned projects and goals;

-  changes in our customers’ demands and expectations;

-  our ability to control costs, as well as to achieve and maintain operational
efficiency;

-  our ability to control our risks;

-  our ability to maintain good relationships with business partners;

-  our financial condition and performance, debt levels and capital needs;

-  our dividend policy;

-  various business opportunities that we may pursue;

other rates or prices, including those pertaining to the PRC and other
countries and regions, and the industry and markets in which we operate; and

-  all other risks and uncertainties described in the section headed “Risk
Factors” in this Document.

only as of the date on which such statement is made, and, except as required by the Listing
Rules, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements
to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to
reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Statements of or references to our
